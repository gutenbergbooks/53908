<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The child who wrote this quaintly-illustrated
diary, eighty-three years ago, was the second
daughter of William Browne, Esq., of Tallentire
Hall, in the County of Cumberland.
She was born there, February 15, 1807.</p>

<p>Descended, on her father's side, from a
race of sturdy Cumberland yeomen, and on
her mother's from the Royal Stuarts and
Plantagenets, she grew up, as might be expected
from this childish production, an
original and uncommon woman.</p>

<p>A keen naturalist and observer of nature,
at a time when such pursuits were unusual,
she delighted in long solitary country rambles
round her beautiful home: an old border
watch-tower, dating from 1280 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>, in full
view of the Solway to the north, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>Skiddaw and the Cumbrian mountains to
the south.</p>

<p>An exquisite collection of butterflies and
moths is still in existence, painted by her
clever fingers from specimens reared by
herself. Each one is depicted upon its
favourite flower, and accompanied by its
caterpillar and chrysalis on the food plant.
This was, alas! left unfinished at her death,
on May 30, 1833, at the early age of twenty-six.</p>

<p>A picture poem, painted on the page of one
of the albums of the period, in drawings so
minute and so finely finished that, like the
butterflies, they can only be adequately seen
through a magnifying-glass, still shows her
accuracy of observation, and the dainty and
patient care of her work.</p>

<p>She loved flowers, and the garden may
still be seen where, in the very early
mornings, she planted and tended with her
own loving care such fragrant, and old-world
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>flowers as rose de meaux, clove pinks, and
gillyflowers.</p>

<p>But these were only the pastimes of a busy
life of unselfish devotion to others. Shy,
retiring, and strangely indifferent to appearance
and to worldly advantages, she was
little understood by the merry young circle
around her. She was, as a child, even considered
stupid and slow, her governess
declaring that 'friend Mary does as well as
she can.' But children loved her, and if
there was sickness or sorrow in the village
it was always 'Miss Mary' who was wanted,
and who was never appealed to in vain.</p>

<p>At a time when rural education was viewed
with suspicion, and Mrs. Hannah More was
contending for the right of the poor to win
knowledge, she and her clever elder sister
opened the first Sunday-school in the neighbourhood.
They also devoted several hours
of every morning to teaching in the village
dame school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>The visit to France recorded in this diary
extended from April 25th to August 12th,
1821. Mary Browne went abroad when she
was fourteen, with her father and mother and
five brothers and sisters, all but one being
younger than herself, and all being alike in
their childish loyalty to their own country,
and their whole-hearted conviction that
everything un-English must be bad; and
that even to admire anything foreign was the
blackest treason. Starting in this firm belief,
they treasured up everything ugly, eccentric,
or uncouth that they came across in their
travels, as may be seen in the primitive but
forcible illustrations of her diary, with no
dawning suspicion that, though different,
foreign customs might nevertheless be better
than the familiar ways.</p>

<p>They travelled slowly, in two of their own
carriages, being a party of thirteen, including
the six children, a governess, nurse, cook,
manservant, and courier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>The long journey; the brief sojourn at
school; Madame Vernier, their cross landlady;
and, above all, the children's delight at
finding themselves again in their beloved
England&mdash;these are all recorded with a vivid
and naive wealth of detail, which makes the
child life of the early days of the nineteenth
century live again as we read of it.</p>

<p>The eldest daughter, Catherine, had been
in France before with her parents, in the
spring of 1815, when Napoleon Buonaparte
escaped from Elba. They were then obliged
to leave Paris hurriedly, travelling night and
day for fear of detention.</p>

<p>To all the other children everything was
new and marvellous, and their keen, though
unconscious, delight in all that they saw is
evident throughout these pages.</p>

<h2>JOURNAL</h2>

<h3>April 1821</h3>


<p class="p2"><i>April 25th, 1821.</i>&mdash;We arrived at London
about eleven o'clock: all the hotels we enquired
at being full, we drove to the British Hotel,
Jermyn Street. We passed through Cavendish
Square, which was very pretty, but I
was rather disappointed at not seeing London
till I was in it. After we had rested, we
walked through Burlington Arcade: it was
quite cool and pleasant, although the weather
was as hot as the middle of summer. There
were rows of shops along each side, which
had many pretty things in them, particularly
artificial flowers; not far from this is the
Egyptian Temple, which has sphinxes, etc.,
carved on it: we saw the Opera House, which
is a very fine building. Regent's Street and
Waterloo Place are built of white stone.
Regent's Street (when finished) is to extend
a long way; at the bottom of it is Carlton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>House, which is very much blackened by
the smoke: there is a great contrast between
it and St. James's Palace, the latter being
built of red brick, and looks like a prison.
In the evening we saw the lamps in Regent's
Street, which was lighter than any other
street I saw; one house was illuminated.
We saw Waterloo Bridge.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>April 26th.</i>&mdash;We went to see the panorama
of Naples: it was a beautiful view, there
were a number of vessels in the bay; after
one had looked long at them, one could
fancy they were moving: in one of the boats
there were some ladies sitting under a crimson
canopy; in another some fruit; in one
place there were some men fishing for mullet
in a kind of round net, with fishes jumping
through it; there was a man swimming with
a basket in one hand, and several other
figures; the ships were painted very gay
colours, the water and the sky were as clear
as crystal, and the whole so natural that one
could hardly persuade oneself that it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>not reality. The next panorama we saw was
the battle of Waterloo: it was not near so
pretty as Naples, it seemed all confusion; the
farmhouse, however, was very natural, also
some of the black horses. We next went to the
panorama of Lausanne: the Lake of Geneva
was very like Keswick Lake, but the lower
end not so pretty; the mountains did not
look very high. There were a great number
of trees; some of them had on kind of covers,
which looked like tombstones; the white
railings and the shadows of the trees were remarkably
natural; there were several figures,
the prettiest was a little child learning to
walk. We went to St. Paul's, and just
walked through it. I thought it very fine,
but spoiled by the blackness. I had no idea
of the height till I observed some people in
the gallery, who looked no bigger than flies;
the pillars were very thick. In our way to
St. Paul's we passed by Perry's glass-shop;
in the window there was a curtain of glass
drops, with two tassels; it had a very pretty
effect, and when the sun shone it appeared all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>colours, but when we entered the shop it was
quite beautiful, there were such numbers of
large glass lamps hanging from the ceiling,
and chandeliers, etc., in all parts. We saw
the jugs belonging to a dessert-set for a
Spanish nobleman, which was to cost twelve
hundred pounds. Also a picture of a lamp
which the King had had made there: it was
gilt dragons with lotuses in their mouths;
in these the lamps were placed so as to be
quite hid. I should think it would be more
curious than pretty. We passed by Green
Park, and saw Lord William Gordon's house,
which has a very nice garden. We drove
through Hyde Park; the trees were very
pretty, and the leaves far out; we passed very
near the Serpentine. It was excessively hot
weather.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>April 27th.</i>&mdash;We saw the Western Exchange,
which is something like a large room
full of shops; from that we went to Miss
Linwood's Exhibition. The pictures were
exactly like paintings; there was a railing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>before them, so that one could not see very
near them; some of the prettiest were Jephtha's
Daughter, a nymph turning into a fountain,
a little girl and a kitten, some children
on an ass, a girl and a bird, a woodman and
a lobster; in a smaller room were several
pictures of our Saviour, the finest was a head;
there was no railing before them, and when
one looked near and could see the stitches,
they looked quite rough; we went along a
passage and looked through a kind of grating
in which there was a head of Buonaparte, in
another a lion's den; but the most amusing
thing was some children in a cottage; underneath
a shelf lay a little black-and-white dog,
which we were afraid to go near thinking it
was alive; Catherine said she saw its eyes
moving. The streets in London were a great
deal prettier than I imagined, such numbers
of shops, carriages, etc.&mdash;indeed the whole far
exceeded my expectation. There were a great
many carriages in Bond Street driving backwards
and forwards.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><i>April 28th.</i>&mdash;We left London about half-past
nine o'clock; we passed close by Westminster
Abbey, which is prettier than St.
Paul's; we had a beautiful view of London
from Westminster Bridge, where I think it
looks best, all the ships look so lively on the
river, and London appears so large. Somerset
House is one side of the Thames; we
had another view after we were out of the
city, where we saw London much better than
when we were coming in; we saw the Monument
and the Tower at a distance: it was
delightful weather, the leaves were quite
out; we saw a great number of butterflies,
one kind of a bright yellow (that I had never
seen before). The country looked very pretty,
but the cottages were not so nice as those in
Hertfordshire; we had several views of the
Thames; we slept at Canterbury.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>April 29th.</i>&mdash;We breakfasted at Dover.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>April 29th.</i>&mdash;We embarked at half-past
nine on board the Trafalgar, Captain Melle;
we waited for passengers for above half
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>an hour; the ship was very full&mdash;there were
twelve of ourselves, a foreigner, Mr. and Mrs.
Wilkinson, six children, their uncle William,
Miss Ash, a manservant and a maid, who
were going to Smyrna; the next people I
observed were three tall young women with
hats and feathers; they had a mattrass put
in a boat, which they lay on, there was an
old woman with them; next came Mr. Johnson,
his sister and daughter; an affected
lady; Mrs. Moses and a little girl; a French
lady and her daughter; two gentlemen with
plaids; a curious old man and an old lady;
besides servants and many other people
whose names I do not know. There were
fifty passengers. It was so foggy that we
could hardly see Dover Cliffs. Before we
sailed the old man came and sat down not
far from us. He was very shabbily dressed,
and looked a curious figure. A man came
and asked him for some money for carrying
down his luggage to the ship. 'Nononono,
no no,' said the old man; 'I paid you for
my breakfast.' 'But my master, and not I,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>got that money,' said the man. 'No no no
no, 'said the old gentleman, tapping the deck
with his cane, and his stomach with his
hand. The man continued to remonstrate,
saying that he paid those who did nothing,
and did not give anything to those who
were really useful; but it was all in vain. So
he went away, and presently returned with
another man, and they both tried to persuade
the old man to give them something.
'Nono-nono-nono,'said he. 'I gave you so
much' (mentioning what it was); 'nono-no.'
'But that was for your breakfast, sir, and
not for carrying your trunks.' 'Nono-no
no; keep it to yourself, keep it to yourself,'
said he, nodding, and at last the two men
were obliged to leave the ship without having
accomplished their purpose. One of
them muttered as he went along, 'I'm sure
if I'd known this I would not have taken all
this trouble; such work as I've had, hunting
after that old man's gloves for this half-hour.'
We could not tell who he was, nor
did any person appear to know him, as they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>sometimes spoke English to him and sometimes
French, he always returning the answer,
'No-no.' He continued to nod and
talk to himself long after the men were gone,
to our great amusement. I was very sorry
to leave England, but I had not much time to
think about it, as the ship began to move.
As I had not been in a ship before, I was
very much frightened, and when the ship
leant to one side I felt as if we were all
falling into the sea together. A great wave
came over the ship, and wetted all the people
at that side, who were obliged to run up
higher. Mamma was so ill, she looked like
death. She said you might have thrown
her into the sea, or done anything with her.
After a short time I was sick also; indeed
there were hardly any of the passengers that
were not, except Euphemia, William, and
Caroline<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>. One of the plaid gentlemen was
very civil, and took Caroline on his knee.
When she was tired she crept by mamma,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>and fell asleep. She scarcely spoke a word,
except once: when I asked her how she
liked being in the ship, she lifted up her
head, and said, 'Not at all.' The gentleman
said he had come over for pleasure, and was
going back again the next day. Oh (thought
I), who can come for pleasure?&mdash;to be sick
oneself, and see every person sick around
one, to be surrounded by people who look
dead or dying, to hear women groaning, and
children crying, and to add to all, to be
shivering with cold&mdash;who can come for pleasure!
Mr. Wilkinson's two little boys cried,
and were rather troublesome; the youngest
had an immense long whip. His little baby
had just recovered from the measles; he
nursed it almost the whole time. The little
girl with Mrs. Moses had, in addition to
being sick, the cramp in her legs. The lady
that was with her did not take any charge of
her except calling out when the ship tacked,
'O child! come to this side, or else you will
be drowned.' The first time somebody was
sick, and called 'Steward,' our little Stewart
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>started up and said, 'What, papa?'<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> William
told us that he looked on one side; he saw
a spout: he looked on the other side; he
saw another spout: so there was nothing
for him to look at but the sea. There were
a number of seabirds and fishes. We got
within sight of Calais in three hours. No
boats came out for a long while, and it was
generally agreed that the men had gone to
the play; but the reason ...</p>

<p class="center">(two pages missing here)</p>

<p>... to their mouths to make him understand,
but he always returned the same
answer, 'O nonononono, nononono,' so they
were obliged to leave him. Only a few
people went in the boats. We laid down on
the deck, with our head on a basket and a
coat over us. The deck was covered with
people lying in a heap like pigs. It was so
disagreeable, that when I heard that we
could not get in till six or seven o'clock, I
thought that I would almost sooner go in
the next boat than stay where I was. Soon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>after, Euphemia told me that the next boat
was come, but we did not go in that either.
Soon after, almost everybody went down to
the cabin, except Carruthers, the affected
lady, and me. The old man again began to
be troublesome: he wanted to get to a chair
at the opposite side of the cabin, and all at
once down he got on his hands and knees,
and began to crawl over the ladies, who
called out, 'O! O dear! he will crush us.'
He then wanted to go to bed, and kept
poking about: he came to Euphemia's bed,
and said, 'I'll get in here. Why mayn't I
get in here?' and he stood upon a chair,
and peeped into the bed. One of the ladies
called out, 'There's a child in that bed.'
'Nononono-no,' said he, and there he stood.
Euphemia prepared herself to jump out of
bed if he got in, but after looking a little
while he went away. Every time she spoke
to Catherine he held up two of his fingers,
and said, 'That won't do, that won't do.'
The affected lady had laid her head on our
knees, and she was never still for a moment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>She kept continually asking how long it
would be before we got in; it was very
foggy, and the sailors had lost sight of the
fort, so this lady thought she would direct
them. 'Oh!'said she, 'I wish I could look
up; I've got such famous eyes,' and then
she sat up. 'Oh yes, I can see it.' One of
the sailors tried to persuade her that one
might fancy anything in a fog, but she still
wanted to direct them. 'I'm sure,' said she,
'I see the fort. It would be much better if
you were to go into the harbour.' They at
last said they thought we should not get in
all night.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Whenever they moved the helm,
the lady screamed out that it would crush
her. I felt very stupid and sleepy, and in a
short time I fell asleep. When they were
going in to Calais we went into the cabin;
they took me down half asleep, and when I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>awoke I could hardly tell where I was; it
looked like a burial-ground; the floor was
covered with people and basons, and it was
almost dark; in a little while we heard that
we were going into the harbour, to our great
joy; I thought I would sooner stay all my
life in France than cross the sea again. We
reached Calais a little after eight; every
person got up and groped about: a gentleman
said it was like a resurrection. One of
Mr. Wilkinson's little girls, about three or
four years old, said, 'Papa, must my kisses
and cakes go to the custom-house?' When
Euphemia<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was getting up she said, 'I think
we all look like wild beasts in our dens';
one of the plaid gentlemen said, 'And you
look like a laughing hyena!' Our brothers
had been all the time in the hold with the
luggage. One of the ladies said she would
never cross the sea again, except to go home.
I was rejoiced to leave the ship, having spent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>one of the longest and most disagreeable
days I had ever felt. When we landed it
was quite dark.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After we had landed we went to the
custom-house. It looked like a public-house,
there were some queer-looking men
and women with long earrings;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> here we
saw the affected lady&mdash;she pulled about her
petticoats and said they should feel that she
had got nothing about her. From this we
went to Rignolle's Hotel; it was very nicely
furnished: there were very pretty clocks on
the chimney-piece. We went to bed directly
after tea; the rooms had a very particular,
disagreeable smell.</p>


<p><i>April 30th</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;We took a walk on the pier:
it was excessively cold and windy; we saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>the place where Louis the Eighteenth first
put his foot on his return from England&mdash;there
is a little piece of brass, of the shape of
a foot, put into the stone: there is also a
pillar on which is marked the time that this
event took place. There was not much difference
between the dress of the people at Calais
and that of the English. The custom-house
officers had examined our things; they took
away nine cambric muslin petticoats, which
were slightly run up, and a worked gown of
mamma's, which they afterwards gave her
back, thinking that she might have worked it.
They took away two yards of cambric muslin
from Miss Wragge;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> they likewise examined
a shawl and a cotton gown of the servant's
many times over: the gown had been washed
several times. The servants dined at a
table d'hôte; there was a dinner which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>thought very fine, a dessert, wines, brandy
and coffee. Rignolle's is a very good hotel;
most of the servants speak English; it is in
the Rue Eustâche de St. Pierre.</p>

<h3>May 1821</h3>


<p class="p2"><i>May 1st.</i>&mdash;Being sufficiently recruited we
recommenced our journey; our horses were
tied with ropes, they looked quite wild; there
were three in each carriage. Calais is surrounded
with fortifications. It was very
cold, disagreeable weather. Papa has a great
aversion to east winds, and dislikes Tallantire
on that account, so we expected that in France
we should find a delightful climate; but
alas! no sooner had we arrived there, than
we found both east and north winds. About
Calais was the ugliest country without exception
I ever beheld; there was scarcely a tree
to be seen, no hedgerows, no pretty cottages,
everything looked dirty and miserable; there
was a great deal of sand, and the country
looked exactly like a desert: I thought that
if this was a specimen of France, it was
certainly a most charming place! We passed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>through La Chaussée, a scattered village
which skirts the road for more than a mile;
after ascending a hill we had a view of the
sea, but the weather was so thick that we
could not see Dover Cliffs. Our horses
began to kick and seemed very restive, but
on the driver's dismounting and calling to
them in a curious voice they were soon quiet;
after we had passed Wimille about a mile
there was a succession of hills as far as
Boulogne: on one of them we had a view of
the town and the tower, which was commenced
by Buonaparte to commemorate his
intended victories over England. We entered
the town by an avenue of trees; we met a
procession in the Rue Grande in honour of
the Duke of Bordeaux's baptism, which was
that day to take place; it was a general fête
throughout France. We stopt till the procession
had passed. The principal things I
remarked were the pioneers with their long
beards and leather aprons, with hatchets over
their shoulders. We went to the Hôtel
Angleterre, Rue de l'Eau; it is kept by an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>Englishman of the name of Parker. We
breakfasted on bouillon. Euphemia had
been very unwell all day: she had no appetite;
so we and Miss Wragge went out to
buy some oranges for her; we asked several
people, and enquired at a number of shops,
but all in vain, and we began to despair: we,
however, succeeded in getting some of an
Englishman&mdash;he was the only person in the
town who sold them; he told us that he got
them from England and was obliged to pay
a high duty; we only took four, as the
smallest were four sous apiece. After leaving
Boulogne the country was a little prettier; it
had not that desert appearance that there
was at the sea-coast. Before we reached
Saumur we saw a woman riding like a man,
wrong side before, on a horse, and a cow
tied to the horse's tail; in some places we
saw women ploughing. About Saumur it
was rather pretty; there were rows of apple-trees
on each side of the road, but on many
of them there was scarcely a leaf; not any of
the trees were so far out as they were in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>England. The country looks barren, as there
are no hedges. The villages in France are
also very ugly&mdash;there are no gardens before
the houses, and instead of the lovely cottages
we saw in Hertfordshire we here saw only
dirty, untidy-looking houses; it was curious
to see the astonishment of the servants, who
imagined that they were to travel through
bowers of grapes and groves of oranges. I
was most disappointed at the weather, as
I expected a delightful climate in France.
After we had passed Saumur we entered the
forest of Longvilliers; we saw some large
lilac periwinkles in the hedge.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> We reached
Montreuil in the evening; there is a very
steep ascent to the town; it is supposed
to be nearly impregnable. We went to
Varennes, Hotel de la Cour de France; it
was a tolerably clean and civil inn. They
told us there was to be a grand illumination
on account of the fête; they begged to put
some lights in our windows, and stuck two
or three candles in. The servants went out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>to see the balls and illuminations: they said
that there were very few lights, and that they
saw some ladies going to the ball, but that,
as for the dance on the green, it was so dark
they could hardly see, but the people appeared
to be in their working dresses; that
there was one fiddler; that first one person
got up and ran across the green, and then
another; but it was nothing like dancing.
At this hotel we first saw the curious French
beds; they consist of a pole in the wall with
the end gilt, over this is thrown a curtain;
sometimes instead of the pole there is an
octagon; the beds are very uncomfortable,
and the curtains slip over one's face. The
basons are like pie-dishes.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="p2"><i>May 2nd.</i>&mdash;It was a cold, disagreeable,
rainy morning when we left Montreuil; the
country was not pretty; we went for a long
way between rows of trees, of which there
was nothing left but the stumps; the branches
are cut off nearly all the trees, which makes
them look like broom-sticks. There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>great numbers of beggars. At every village
we passed we were followed by men, women
and children; if we gave to a few they came
in a double quantity up to the carriage-window;
in one village we counted about
twenty. Begging seemed to be quite a trade:
in some places they brought baskets with
cakes and flowers in them; if we would not
buy the flowers they threw them into the
carriage. In one place a little girl ran by
the side of the carriage and said in English
'How do you do? Very well thank you.
Give me a penny, papa. How do you do,
my dear? I hope you're very well.' Papa
asked them where they had learned to speak
English; they answered that the English
had lived there three years. In one of the
villages where we stopped two little girls
came and danced by our carriage; they
danced in a slow, dull kind of way, and sung
a tune something like our quadrilles. The
people were in general fat, plain and clumsy;
their eyes were half shut, they looked like
the pictures one sees of Chinese. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>women wore a woollen or cotton petticoat
with a body of a different colour, an apron
with shoulder-straps, and a coarse cotton
handkerchief: some had high caps on their
heads, but most of them wore a checked
handkerchief done up like a toque, and long
earrings; they had scarcely any hair to be
seen, which was very unbecoming. Their
waists were generally very short, and they
looked quite a bundle; some of them wore
sabots (wooden shoes). The children<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> were
heavy, ugly figures; they were quite muffled
up with clothes, and had very large stomachs,
and their clothes were tied over their breasts.
They had not the liveliness of children in
England; they seemed so fat they could
hardly walk,&mdash;like what in Scotland they call
<i>douce bairns</i>; they had all caps or handkerchiefs
on, even the babies. The men wore
coloured woollen nightcaps; they were much
better-looking than the women. All the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>people looked untidy and dirty. We passed
through the Forest of Cressy, near which was
fought the celebrated battle which bears its
name. We reached Abbeville about one
o'clock: we breakfasted at the Hôtel d'Angleterre,
which is a very good inn, but was rather
in confusion when we were there. At Flixcourt,
where we stopped to change horses, we
saw some people dancing on a green; they
told us it was on account of a wedding. In
several of the villages there were people
standing at their doors eating bean-bread;
in one stage we tasted it; it was rather sour,
but not bad tasting. The people did not
seem to make much use of their houses, as
we often saw them out of doors. It was
above six o'clock when we arrived at Amiens.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
The entrance into the town is pretty. We
went to the cathedral; it has a pretty light
spire: there is a beautiful portal with figures
carved all round. The inside is very prettily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>ornamented; the pulpit is supported by Faith,
Hope and Charity; above it are three angels
holding a curtain underneath which is the
glory; all the figures are gilt. There are
two pretty painted wheel-windows; the organ
is silver, and looks rather poor. There are
little chapels round the inside of the cathedral,
and images with cases of artificial
flowers before them. The pillars are so
formed that when you strike them they
sound as if they were hollow. I did not
think it altogether near so grand as York
Minster, but it is a very pretty thing. The
concierge told us that he had seen ten thousand
in the church. When you look up it
looks too low, as if the top was cut off.
There were several nuns<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> walking up and
down the cathedral. We returned to dinner
at the Hôtel des Ambassadeurs, where we
slept; it is quite in the French style, with
red stone floors, no grates, fine clocks, etc.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><i>May 3rd.</i>&mdash;In the morning when we asked
for soap they said they had none in the
house; we at last sent out to buy a piece,
and they brought us in a bit of coarse brown
soap. The soap that the French wash their
things with smells of aniseed and gives their
beds a disagreeable smell. The inn was by
far the worst we met with; and the servants
were very careless. We set out with very fine
weather for the first time, and as the day
advanced two or three butterflies made their
appearance. Our postillion seemed very gay,
as he sung most of the time; presently some
of the ropes broke about the horses' heads,
and while he was employed in mending, with
the help of another bit of rope and an old
knife, the postillion at the other carriage had
also dismounted, and was amusing himself
by plaiting up his horses' tails. The harness
often broke and the horses kicked, but the
men did not seem to mind it; if we asked
what was the matter, they always answered,
'Soyez tranquille, soyez tranquille.' The
French horses are little, clumsy-looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>beasts. At Hebecourt we met a kind of
covered cart full of children and nurses
going to the Hospital des Enfans Trouvés
at Paris; there was a soldier to guard it,
who sat on his horse like a woman and
slapped his horse's face. There seems to
be a great want of living creatures in the
fields; we never met any except here and
there a drove of pigs with very long legs, or
a walnut-coloured old woman leading (by a
string) a thin, miserable-looking cow. We
once met a flock of sheep which followed a
man like dogs. Breteuil is a mean, dirty
town; we had a very bad breakfast in the
Hôtel de &mdash;&mdash;.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The country about Breteuil
is very dreary and unpleasant. We saw
several vineyards which were not near so
pretty as I expected: they were little, diminutive-looking
things, not so high as raspberry
bushes. Near the villages we saw a number
of people washing in the <i>lavoirs</i> or ponds
made purposely. There were, as usual, plenty
of beggars; some of whom came and begged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>for bread and wine. One of our postillions
had a dog with him; he threw off his gloves,
the dog always picking them up and bringing
them to him. Soon after we had passed the
village of Wavigny we were overtaken by a
violent storm of rain, hail, thunder and lightning,
and as the storm increased we were
glad to take shelter in the post-house at St.
Just. Here we had a good deal of conversation
with a servant girl; she told us that they
kept all the cattle in stables, and never out
of doors. Seeing some pigs that looked finer
than usual in the farmyard, she said that
they had got them from a school where they
brought up pigs. She had a child in her
arms which she offered to us all to kiss.
When we asked what it eat, she said soup
and sweetmeats; she afterwards brought it
in some sugar and milk. The child had on
a cotton cap trimmed with black net: when
she took it off to show us its hair, we told
her how much better it looked without it;
she said 'yes, but that in France they were
afraid of their children catching cold if they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>went without caps': which accounts for
one's never seeing the children's neck, arms,
or hair. The people seemed to have been at
dinner; there was a large plate of cabbage,
some curd, and apples on the table. Before
we went away mamma gave the girl a franc;
she seemed hardly to know whether to accept
it or not, turned it about, and at last put it
into her pocket without saying a word. We
were amused at one of our servants saying
'It's well we're off the <i>common</i> now it rains'
(owing to the want of hedgerows and trees,
the country did look more like a common
than anything else). When we set out the
storm had abated, but the water was running
over the road in streams. A little further on
the hail was collected into large heaps, some
of them nearly three feet long, and above
half a foot thick: these were lying on the sides
of the road, and over the fields for a quarter
of a mile. We picked up some small pieces:
they were hail and mud stuck together; the
hailstones were bigger than large peas. A
few miles from St. Just we had a very fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>view of Clermont; the town and castle are
situated on a hill, nearly surrounded by
wood. It was about here that a little dog
which I fed with bread followed us for near
half a mile. The country was very pretty
as we approached Chantilly: the wood of
Hallate borders the road on the left, in which
we saw some wood pigeons; nearer the town
is a meadow, and canals are on each side of
the road. In entering Chantilly one of the
horses got its leg over the traces, and horse
and man fell down beside the carriage; they,
however, got up without any accident. We
drove to the Hôtel de Bourbon, an excellent
inn. The mistress is a nice, civil little
woman; the master, who is also cook, was
twenty years in England. The rooms were
very nicely furnished; in the parlour was a
jug full of lilies of the valley, which gave the
room a very sweet smell. While dinner was
preparing we walked out towards the palace
stables. We passed by several neat houses,
with gardens and trellis-work covered with
vines before the door. The trellis-work was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>arched: I should think when it is covered
with bunches of grapes it must be very
pretty. The stables consist of one enormous
building, six hundred feet in length and forty
in height; above the entrance are some very
fine figures and horses. There was formerly
a figure, which the Allies melted into cannon
balls when they were quartered there. The
palace was destroyed by a mob from Paris
early in the Revolution; a smaller château
connected with it was spared, which is now
the habitation of the Prince of Condé.
Several people asked if we wanted to see
the inside of the stables, but we had not
sufficient time. It was a very fine evening,
the country round was very beautiful; there
was a great deal of wood about it. We
walked a little in the garden belonging to the
inn; there were an immense number of cockchafers
that flew humming over our heads.
Soon after we returned there was a great
deal of thunder and lightning. Before I
went to bed I sat and watched it at a
window; when it lightened, the whole sky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>seemed illuminated. It continued during
part of the night, so that we were obliged
to close the windows. I liked Chantilly
better than any place I had seen in France.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>May 4th.</i>&mdash;Before we set off we got some
rolls to take in the carriage. They were not
the rolls, a yard and half a quarter long, but
quite round like rings, that the bakers carry
hung over their arms. We took a turn in
the garden, where we met with an Irishman,
who told us a great deal about the stables,
etc. He said that the Prince of Condé had
an extensive forest, where he was very fond
of hunting; that one day he would hunt the
wild-boar, another day the roe-buck, another
the stag, and so on. After we had left Chantilly
the country was very pretty, and the
forest of Chantilly soon began to skirt the
road on the left. Near Ecouen is a seminary
for the education of the orphan daughters of
the members of the Legion of Honour. As
we approached Paris, the postillions were
very smart, their queues were well powdered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>and at one place their boots were so large
that they stepped into them. Whenever
the French postillions come near to a town
or village, they begin to crack their whips
very dexterously, with which they make an
immense noise. The horses are tied with
ropes, have sheep-skins over their backs, and
are always three abreast. Near many of the
villages we saw crucifixes and images. There
are some little obelisks on the side of the
road, where Philip the Bold and his brothers
rested when they bore the corpse of their
father from Paris to St. Denis. There is an
avenue of trees on each side of the road which
bears marks of the ravages of war. Soon
after the village of La Chapelle we passed
the barrier of Paris. We entered Paris along
the Rue de Clichy. We stopped at Meurice's
Hôtel, Rue St. Honoré. The sitting-room
was carpeted and had a boarded floor; there
was a pretty clock and vases of alabaster on
the chimney-piece, and mirrors about the
room; the furniture was a kind of figured
blue cotton velvet, which they have a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>deal of in France. Meurice and many of
the waiters speak English; the inn is very
good; the servants did not seem to hear the
bells, but we thought that was probably
because we were at the back of the house,
rather out of the way. The back of the hotel
looks towards the gardens of the Tuileries.
We went to bed directly after tea.</p>

<h4>TUILERIES</h4>

<p><i>May 5th.</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;We took a walk in the gardens
of the Tuileries. The palace was founded
by Catherine de Medicis, and derives its
name from having been erected on a piece of
ground appropriated to the manufacture of
tiles. The front consists of five pavilions,
connected with four ranges of buildings. The
whole façade is adorned with Ionic pillars
placed on pedestals. All the pillars are
formed of brown and red marble. The portico
of the centre pavilion towards the court is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>decorated by columns, and on each side of
the gate are statues of Apollo and a Faun.
The portico towards the garden is similarly
ornamented. On the galleries are eighteen
marble statues of Roman senators clad in
the toga, and in other parts of the façade
are twenty-two busts of Roman emperors
and generals. The extraordinary height of
the roof in front towards the garden gives
an air of heaviness to the façade. An iron
palisade encloses the coachyard of the palace.
The principal entrance to the court of the
Tuileries is by a most beautiful triumphal
arch. It was erected by Napoleon, and was
built on the plan of that of Septimus Severus
at Rome, and is said not to be inferior to the
original. It is sixty feet wide and forty-five
feet high. The centre arch is fourteen feet
wide, the others eight and a half. Each
front is decorated with four columns, supporting
marble figures, representing different
soldiers. On the outside are, on the right,
the arms of France, supported by Peace and
Plenty; and on the left the arms of Italy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>sustained by Wisdom and Strength. Four
other bas-reliefs are over the smaller arches.
The inside of the arches is beautifully carved.
Over the centre arch was formerly the statue
of Napoleon. The gardens are the work of
Lenostre; the principal walk extends through
the whole length of the garden. The trees
are all cut, which gives it a formal look. In
the parterres of flowers are statues and basins
of water; in one were two swans, and in the
others some gold and silver fishes. From
the terrace of the garden towards the Seine
we had a very fine view of the river; and on
the opposite terrace, of the Place Vendôme,
the triumphal column, and the Boulevards
beyond. Along the walks are rows of chairs,
for which you pay two or three sous: there
are also stone seats. In the afternoon these
gardens are crowded by a gay assembly.
In returning we passed through the Place
Vendôme. The buildings which enclose the
square on three sides are uniform. In the
middle is a beautiful column 130 feet high,
formed on the model of that of Trajan at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>Rome. It is entirely covered with brass,
furnished by the artillery taken from the
Austrians. The pedestal is fitted with bas-reliefs,
and at each angle is an eagle grasping
a crown of laurel. At the foot of the column
commences another set of bas-reliefs, which
trace in chronological order the principal
events of the campaign of 1805: a spiral line
separates each row. On the top of the column
is a gallery, and above the gallery is a small
dome on which is a white flag. There were
a great many carriages in the square, so that
we had to skip first to one side, then the other.
There are no pavements for foot passengers
in the streets of Paris, which makes it very
disagreeable to walk; the coachmen drive
close to the very doors of the houses, and if
it were not for the <i>portes cochères</i>, one would
be run over by the carriages. The streets
are narrow and dirty, and the shops in general
very shabby. There were a good many
people about with nosegays; we bought a
bunch of lilies-of-the-valley and ranunculuses
for two or three sous. The flower-girls are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>quite troublesome; they follow one and throw
the flowers into one's hand.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>May 6th.</i>&mdash;We were very much surprised
at having a very good plum-pudding at
dinner, and on enquiry we found that they
had one every Sunday. The servants complained
terribly of not having enough to eat;
they said that sometimes they could not each
get a potatoe: and other things in proportion.
A great many troops passed by the
door.</p>


<h4>JARDIN DES PLANTES</h4>

<p><i>May 7th.</i><a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>&mdash;Soon after breakfast we set
out in a carriage to go to the Jardin des
Plantes. We crossed the Seine by the Pont
Royal; the river is dirty and muddy, the
water is so green that it cannot be drunk
without being filtered. On the bridge were
several women clipping poodles, and the
limonadiers, both men and women, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>passing backwards and forwards with their
castles full of lemonade or sorbets on their
backs, their cocks by their sides, and their
tin cups over their shoulders, crying as they
went along, 'Voulez-vous boire, voulez-vous
boire?' Some of them had larger things, a
great deal ornamented. When we alighted
at the entrance of the botanic garden several
women crowded round us, begging us to
buy a description of the menagerie. It was
a very fine day. This charming garden was
founded by Jean de la Brasse, physician to
Louis <span class="smcap">xiii</span>. At the entrance of the garden
are several square enclosures. The first
contains different kinds of soil and manure;
in the second are specimens of hedges, fences,
and ditches; there are likewise every different
method of training fruit-trees, some like a
cup, some like a pyramid, and two trees
fastened together with a gate between them.
In another enclosure are vegetables, and in
another different kinds of fruit-trees and
bowers. We then walked to the menagerie,
near which are some very fine Judas trees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>which were covered with lilac flowers. The
wild beasts' dens were very large and kept
remarkably clean. There were several lions,
tigers, panthers, hyenas, wolves and bears;
but what pleased me most was a dog in the
den with one of the lions. One very fierce-looking
black bear was rearing up against
the bars. The bears were formerly kept in
sunken enclosures, but since an accident
happened they have been confined with the
other wild beasts.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> At the end of the
menagerie is the aviary, the bars of which
were so close that we could hardly see into
it; there did not seem many rare birds, but
plenty of monkeys were skipping about.
Some distance off this is the house for the
elephant: it is a large-looking building near
a pond, the whole enclosed by a railing.
The elephant was plunging about and enjoying
the water while its keeper was rubbing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>it with a wet broom. In several enclosures
were antelopes, deer, elks, and different kinds
of sheep. They were so tame as to come up
to the railings and take pieces of bread out
of the people's hands. In one enclosure
were different kinds of fowls, storks, and an
ostrich, and a Botany Bay bird of immense
height. There were also two old camels, and
two young ones. There were some curious
long-eared goats, which were very tame. In
the pit, where the bears were formerly, are
now some wild boars, and several young
ones. The botanic garden consists of more
than seven thousand plants, every one of
which is labelled, and the beds are divided
by little hedges of box. A piece of water,
supplied from the Seine, is appropriated to
the aquatic plants. We did not look into
the greenhouses or hothouses: several of the
plants were ranged out of doors. After we
had passed these we ascended by a path an
artificial hill at the top of which is a kind
of temple: from this we had a view of the
greater part of Paris. The Museum of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Natural History is at the end of the garden
opposite the entrance; it is open on Tuesday
and Friday. We could not see it the day
we were at the garden.</p>

<h4>LOUVRE AND PALAIS ROYAL</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>May 8th.</i>&mdash;As we had taken a house at
Passy, the servants and trunks went there:
but we staid till the afternoon that we might
see the Gallery of the Louvre and as much
of Paris as we could. In the first saloon of
this museum are the earliest works of the
French and Italian artists. In the next the
celebrated battle-pieces of Le Brun. We
then entered the great gallery, which appears
to have no end; this magnificent apartment
is fourteen hundred feet in length. The
ceiling is particularly pretty. I was very
much disappointed in the pictures; there
were such a number that I could hardly distinguish
them. The Déluge by Poussin is
very sublime. I also admired the St. Michael
vanquishing Satan. The inside of a kitchen,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>and another painting in which there is a
lamp, are very natural. There is a picture of
some dogs, and another of some game, both
of which I liked. A basket of fruit and
some butterflies is also very pretty.</p>

<p>From the Louvre we went to the Palais
Royal. It was begun by Cardinal Richelieu
in 1629, and completed in 1636. It was converted
by the Duke of Orleans into a bazaar:
the front towards the street of St. Honoré
was built by him after the destruction of the
Opera House. It presents two pavilions
adorned with columns. After passing under
a portico we entered a square. In the
centre is a garden interspersed by young
trees and encircled by lattice work; in the
middle of the garden is a <i>jet d'eau</i>, which cools
the air very much. Round the square are
beautiful little shops; the prettiest are the
jewellers'. In the windows were a great
many ornaments of mother-of-pearl, harps,
dogs, men, carts, etc. The china-shops are
very pretty also. One very pretty ornament
was a gold boy with a china cup on his back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>and a dog holding a stick in its mouth, at
each end of which was a glass for ink; there
were bead-necklaces, smelling-bottles, and
every kind of thing. When we returned we
went immediately to Passy. This village
was about a mile from Paris. When
we arrived at our house in the Rue Basse,
we found all hands busily employed in cleaning.
It was a large house, but dirty from
top to bottom. It had been occupied for a
year by an English family who had been
abroad for three years; their housekeeper
and lady's-maid were English, and disliked
being in France so much that they sat in
their own rooms and left the management of
the house entirely to the foreign servants.
There was a courier who bought and managed
for the family. The consequence was
that we found the house in the greatest confusion.
The kitchen was like a pig-sty, and
the rooms were very dirty and untidy. There
were backs of books, old bottles, and all
kinds of litters lying about. There was a
German housemaid who was to stay on in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>the house with us, and she and our servants
did little that day but clean. Though we
were all anxious to come to a house, I began
to think I would sooner have stayed where
we were than come here. When we went to
bed we expected at least to be at rest, instead
of which the beds were so full of bugs that
we were bit all over.</p>


<h4>PASSY</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>May 9th.</i>&mdash;We got up pretty early, glad
enough to leave our dirty, disagreeable beds.
The servants began to clean the kitchen, but
the smell was so bad that it made them sick;
they therefore got two men in to clean it;
and when they came to the pipe that carried
away the dirt, they were also unable to proceed
till they got a glass of brandy. The
oven was an inch thick with dirt; when it
was a little cleaned they discovered a looking-glass
at the back of the oven. All the egg-shells,
stalks of vegetables, etc., had been
thrown under the charcoal fires; the rolling-pin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>was covered with dirt. Indeed, a dirtier
place could not have been imagined. The
meat chopper was also an inch thick of dirt.
The cellar was overrun with lizards, and the
closets with ants, etc. It was rather more
agreeable out of doors. The front of the
house was turned from the street, and before
it were two terraces, one above the other,
which were covered with vines, and at the
end were some fine Judas trees. From the
terrace we had a view of the Seine and Paris.
The weather was fine, but we none of us
were in a humour to enjoy this view. The
porter that lived at the end of the terrace
had a little boy of five or six years old.
François was a nice boy, but, like most of the
French children, rather forward. We walked
through the village as far as the Bois de
Boulogne. There are streets in Passy like
a town, but very few shops; the people who
live there get all their things from Paris.
We picked up several cantheræ.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>May 10th.</i>&mdash;We now found the dirt so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>intolerable that mamma determined to speak
to Madame Gautier, the lady from whom we
had taken the house. She said that she
would have the house cleaned and painted;
but that if we wished to leave it, not to consider
that any agreement had been made.
(Our house had been taken for a year.) On
hearing this papa went immediately to Versailles
to look after a house; when he returned
he told us that he had taken one, to
which we were to go next day. We went to
bed in rather better spirits, comforting ourselves
that it was the last night we should
sleep here.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>May 11 th.</i>&mdash;This morning we were busy
packing and settling our things. We were
rather at a loss about some clothes which we
had at the wash, not knowing how we could
get them. The porter, however, told us that
we might be easy, as he knew a coachman
who passed constantly by the door, with
whom he would send the things. That we
might be sure, we again asked him if he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>certain of being able to send the things; but
he repeated his answer so often that we had
not the least doubt of his being as good as
his promise. Soon after breakfast we set off
in a cabriolet, which is rather a curious conveyance,
but very roomy. It has two seats,
one before the other, and it opens in front
where the man sits. It jogged very much
going downhill. There is only one horse.
The man drove so close behind the cabriolet
in which the servants were that we could not
see anything; on asking him to go to one
side he went straight before. Presently he
stopped and took up another man, which
they call a 'lapin,' and they chatted and
laughed all the way, frequently stopping to
get little glasses of brandy, as all the French
drivers do. They stopt for a long while
at a post-house, where the men got some
bread out of a bin in the corner, and some
wine. The people at the inn brought us out
a few little cakes, for which they afterwards
charged several francs. It was about the
middle of the day when we got to Versailles.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a name="ill09" id="ill09"></a><img src="images/p0085.jpg" width="600" height="430" alt="" />
<div class="caption">CABRIOLET</div>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>It is a nice-looking town. There are three
avenues up the middle. The soldiers were
exercising in the Avenue de Sceaux when we
passed; they exercised there several times a
week. We used to like to hear their music,
but they spoilt it with drumming. Our house
was near the end of the Avenue de Sceaux,
No. 6. Before the door was what they called
'Deux jolis jardins,' which turned out to be
a small garden with a walk, and two hedges
up the middle which divided it. We had
not the upper story of the house. We paid
300 francs a month. The rooms were all
round a court, so that one had to pass from
one room to get to another. The drawing-room
was furnished quite after the French
fashion: there was a round table with two
large pieces of marble on it; another table supported
by bronze sphinxes; a beautiful piece
of furniture that had belonged to the palace,
which contained fourteen secret drawers
and several mirrors. But besides this there
were two clocks, neither of which would go;
linen curtains hung on common iron rods;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>common painted frames round the glasses.
Instead of a carpet there was a very little
shabby piece of green cloth; and no grate;
and such fire-irons as you would not see in
an English kitchen. The furniture was
stamped blue cotton-velvet. On the floor
of the dining-room there was a little ragged
piece of old tapestry; this and the green
cloth were the only pretensions to carpet in
the house, so that what with the want of
grates and the red stone floors, it looked very
cold and comfortless. But that we did not
much mind, as the heat was what we always
dreaded. The locks of the doors hurt all our
fingers, they were so stiff. After we had
thoroughly looked through the house, we
went out to walk through the town. The
trees in the avenues are kept cut, which is
very formal-looking. We passed before the
King's stables. They are in the form of a
half moon; before the court is a railing with
gilt tops. The great and the little stable are
separated by the Avenue de Paris. Nearly
opposite is the palace. Higher up the avenue,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>on the side of the Grande Ecurie, is the kennel.
It looks pretty, and I think very large for a
dog-kennel; it was, however, found too small.
After walking as far as the Place d'Armes
(which separates the old from the new town)
we returned, and spent the evening in condoling
with one another.</p>


<h4>VERSAILLES PALACE</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>May 12th.</i>&mdash;We went this day to see the
palace and the gardens. When one looks at
it, from the side next Paris, one might fancy
it was a town of itself, there seem so many
different buildings. As you go up to it
there are some curious-looking buildings in
imitation of tents. The iron railing that
separates the palace from the Place d'Armes
is very much ornamented and gilt, and on
each side there is a group of gilt figures.
After passing by the chapel we entered
the park. On this side the palace is
1800 feet long, and from its great
length looks rather low. The park of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>Versailles is divided into the great and the
little park, which united form a circuit of
sixty miles. The great park includes several
villages. The little park includes the gardens,
the groves, the pieces of water, etc. There
are several entrances. The principal one is
by the arcades of the palace. When one
stands in the middle of the terrace one sees
the Basin of Latona, the Tapis-vert, Apollo's
Bath, and the canal at the right, the parterre
of the north, and Neptune's Bath; and at
the left the parterre of flowers, the orangery,
and the <i>pièce d'eau des Suisses</i>. The whole
garden seems almost composed of statues
and vases. The vases are, I think, the most
beautiful things in the garden; they are
mostly of white marble (a few are of bronze),
and covered with the most beautiful carving;
some are very simple, having only a border
round them, and others are covered with
figures, sunflowers, or vines. There are also
a great many basins of water. The finest is
Neptune's Bath. It is a large piece of water
surrounded by twenty-two vases. There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>several groups of figures: the principal one
in the front is Neptune and Amphitrite
seated in a large shell, and surrounded by
tritons and naiads. Apollo's Bath is another
very fine one. Apollo is represented in his
car drawn by four horses, and surrounded
by sea-monsters. Latona's basin is as
curious as any: in the middle, on several
steps of red marble, are Latona and her
children, and around them, on the steps, are
seventy-four frogs, which represent the
Lybian peasants metamorphosed by Jupiter
on the complaint made to him by Latona.
Some of them seem half frogs and half men.
Besides these there are a great many smaller
basins. There is one basin which seems
gone to decay. In it is represented the
giant Enceladus crushed under the ruins of
Mount Olympus, and a number of groups of
bronze children supporting basins. Around
many of them are parterres of flowers.</p>

<p>The Tapis-vert is a long piece of grass, at
each side of which are numerous vases and
statues. In the evening, before sunset, this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>is the favourite promenade, and is quite
crowded by all ranks of people. It is a
favourite game to try and walk down this
green blindfold. The canal is at the bottom
of the Tapis-vert, below Apollo's Bath. It
is very long, but not very pretty, as it does
not finish with anything; it is crossed by
another canal, which conducts to the Trianon.</p>

<p>There are a great many long avenues and
squares, several of which are closed. The
avenues looked suitable to the rest of the
garden, but <i>very</i> formal. There are also
rows of yew-trees cut into every kind of
formal shape, which spoils the look of the
gardens very much. The prettiest part of
the garden is Hartwell, or the King's garden,
which is made in imitation of the place
where he resided when in England. It is
very like an English garden. In the middle
is a column of very pretty marble, with a
small figure of Flora at the top. This
garden is railed in, but is open every evening
for people to walk in. I was very
much disappointed in the orangery: it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>lower than the rest of the garden. Most of
the orange-trees were standing out, but there
is a gallery to put them in. There is a basin
of water in the middle of the orangery, and
borders of flowers all round. There are
immense numbers of orange, lemon, citron,
laurel, and pomegranate trees:&mdash;the oldest
orange-tree is said to be five hundred years
old; but they are by no means pretty; they
are all in large tubs; and instead of the
branches being allowed to spread, they are all
cut like box, which make them look still
more formal. Even the flowers in the borders
of the orangery are planted alternately yellow
and white. The blossoms of the oranges are
sold. From the orangery we had a view of
the Etang Suisse; it looks like a dirty pond
on a common. The whole garden is open
to every person till nine o'clock, when a
drum beats. At the entrance there is a list
of rules: no dogs are to be brought in unless
tied with a string; and nobody is to
fish in the ponds, or to touch the statues or
flowers. Notwithstanding, however, these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>prohibitions, I have counted seven or eight
dogs at one time running over the flower-borders,
and boys climbing on the beautiful
vases, or fishing for gold and silver fish, of
which there are a great many, particularly in
Apollo's Bath. As we returned through the
court, several very ugly old women pressed
round us and asked whether we would like
to see the apartments of the palace, but we
thought it was better to defer this till another
day.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>May 13th.</i>&mdash;I was very much surprised to
see here, as well as at Paris, not the least
regard paid to Sunday. All the shops were
open, houses were building, and people sitting
working at their doors, seeming more
industrious this day than any other; even
the tradespeople made a point of bringing
their things on a Sunday. The English
clergyman was a Mr. Beaver. At church we
saw several people that we had formerly seen
at Clifton and Bath; it was quite full of
English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<h4>JACK</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>May 14th.</i>&mdash;About this time a little circumstance
happened which shows the French
inconsistency. We wanted a jack put up in
the kitchen. The mason and his boy came
first, but not finding the blacksmith there,
they went away; then came the blacksmith
and his boy, but not finding the mason, they
went away. After going on in this way for
some time, they at last all met. The mason
then took out of a paper bag some delicate-looking
white powder, which, after mixing
into a paste, he layed with great care on to
a fine silver trowel, and then proceeded to
dab it on to the wall with his fingers.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>May 15th.</i>&mdash;We now began to be rather
surprised that the clothes we had left at
Passy, and which the porter said he would
send directly, had not arrived. Stephens, our
foreign courier, who spoke English, was therefore
despatched to bring them. We afterwards
found that, so far from knowing a person
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>to send them by, the porter had consulted
with Stephens and asked him if he knew of
any person; so that we might have waited
long for our clothes if we had trusted to the
porter's word. The French are very fond of
making promises, but not quite so fond of
performing them; this we found to be the
case with our house: one of our beds broke
down several times; some rooms wanted
tables, some jugs, some carpets, and all
window-curtains&mdash;so that you could see across
the yard from one room to another; they
found it very easy to promise all these things,
but we waited many a week before we got
one. The English family above us had one
baby of a few months old, called Angelica
Ellen, which we were very fond of nursing.
The lady was so ill as not to be able to attend
to it, and seemed to leave it entirely to the
care of a French nurse, who attended to it
very badly. She would take it out in the
rain, or give it to anybody in the street to
hold, while she played at hide-and-seek with
the old porter and his wife, who looked to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>be above seventy; she one day let it fall
into the fire and burnt all its poor little
hands. There is a porter to all the French
houses. Our porter's wife took care of children:
we sometimes used to get her in to
clean the pans, etc.; then the nurse used to
come in also to chat with her and meddle
with the things in the kitchen.</p>


<h4>TRIANONS</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>May 19th.</i>&mdash;This day was, for a rarity, very
warm. We saw in the garden a swallow-tail
butterfly and some small red moths, which
were almost the only kinds I saw in France.
I never saw anywhere so few butterflies: we
thought it quite a treat to see a single white
one. There was the same scarcity of birds;
and, notwithstanding the quantity of wood in
the gardens, we hardly heard one. In the
middle of the day we walked to the Trianons.
The Grand Trianon is situated at the extremity
of one of the branches of the canal.
We went to it from the palace garden along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>a hayfield, near which we sometimes saw
the soldiers playing at ninepins. Near the
Trianons were some tall lombardy poplars and
some very pretty acacias. At the gate were
a great many soldiers. An avenue leads up
to the little Trianon, which, though it is
called a palace, is not larger than a small
private house. The Grand Trianon is very
pretty, but looks small after the other
great palace: it is adorned with eight green
marble, and fourteen red marble pillars. We
this day saw neither the inside nor the
gardens, but merely passed by it. Lower
down was a pond near which some sheep
were feeding, which, with the wood of the
forest, formed a pretty scene. We returned
through part of the forest, and home through
the gardens. As we were going along one of
the walks we saw a great many people running,
and on enquiring the reason we were
told it was to see the Duchesse d'Angoulême:
we saw her go into one of the walks which were
closed, and afterwards pass through the Orangerie.
She was on horseback; there were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>some ladies and gentlemen beside her, and
other attendants behind. She was dressed
in a dark habit; her eyes were red, as if she
had been crying, and she was not good-looking.
We saw her two or three times afterwards,
when she came to visit a college for
educating priests to send over the country,
and which was very near our house. We
often saw scores of students going a-walking
in their long black gowns tucked up through
the pocket-hole. They were in general very
vulgar and ungentlemanly-looking. The
people did not seem to pay them much
respect, as the porter's wife and the nurse
pointed, and then burst out a-laughing
when they passed. There were above three
hundred at the college.</p>


<h4>BALL</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>May 17th.</i>&mdash;There was this day a ball
given at the palace in honour of the Duke
of Bordeaux's baptism. Mamma did not go,
as Mrs. Murray, the only person she knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>there, could not go on account of the death
of a friend. They said the supper was to be
very splendid. We went to a <i>pâtissier</i> to see
some of the ornaments. There were very
few, and those were not very pretty: one of
the best was the arms of France, made of
cake and ornamented with coloured paste.
They told us that there were no more ornaments
for supper than what we saw; but
there must have been more, as we saw people
carrying several out of the shop into another
room: what we saw were merely a few in the
windows. In the evening we walked towards
the palace to see the illuminations. Beside
the gate and across the court were pieces of
iron this shape <img src="images/p0062.png" width="10" height="20" alt="" />
to which the lamps were
fastened. The carriages drove up between
the rows of lamps. Mamma and my sisters
were not a little surprised to see a <i>gondole</i>
(which is the same kind of thing as a stage-coach)
drive up to the entrance. The driver
lifted out of it a very fat, gouty lady, dressed
in a black lace gown over a white satin slip;
she had a white satin turban on her head,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>short sleeves, and dirty-looking, lead-coloured
gloves. She had very thick legs, and there
was something very peculiar about her feet.
She had worsted stockings on! This is one
of the instances out of many of the inconsistency
of the French, in dress as well as
in other things. The poorest-looking people
will have gold chains and earrings, although
in other respects remarkably shabbily dressed.
The lower class of people are much worse
dressed than the English.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>May 20th.</i>&mdash;We all now began to feel
very uncomfortable; everything was so very
different to the things in an English house.
From the drawing-room to the kitchen all
was uncomfortable, and the habits of the
people were so dirty and untidy that our
three English servants begged that they
might do the work themselves instead of
having a foreigner to assist them. Stephens
our courier was gone, so that we had often to
go with Carruthers (our cook) to the market
to speak for her. When she went by herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>she, however, contrived to make herself
understood; she went all round the market
and searched about till she got hold of the
thing she wanted, then she touched it and
said, <i>Combeen</i>. She soon learnt a few words
such as <i>pom-de-tary, chu, mungy, francs,
sows, kickshaws</i>, etc.; if she did not understand
what they said she answered <i>Inglytary
nong comprehendy</i>. Robins (our manservant)
got on best; he stammered out a word of
French and a word of English, till by words
and signs he contrived to get what he wanted.
One word they all knew, and that was <i>bukkah,
bukkah</i>; they were so determined not
to be cheated that Carruthers went all the
way back from the Avenue de Sceaux to the
market if she found they owed her one sou.
Notwithstanding all our care we frequently
were cheated; they will try every possible
means:<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> sometimes when the market-people
set down what we had bought, they would
write down a few more pence than they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>before charged, or contrive some other way
for getting money. The provisions at Versailles
were fully dearer than in England.
One of the best shops in the market was
Madame Segan's, although she, as well as
the rest, would cheat if she could. The
butter was very bad in France. Madame
Segan's was the best, but as there was no
salt in it, and they only got it once a week,
it did not keep good. The butcher's meat
(except the pork and veal) is not good: they
have a curious custom of blowing it up so as
to look very large. The French bread being
made of leaven is very sour; we got English
bread from a baker at Versailles. Another
good shop for eggs, etc., is The Black Hen.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Madame Vernier, the woman whom we
took the house from, was a <i>restaurateur</i> next
door, so we often got some dishes from her.
Her <i>chef de cuisine</i> used sometimes also to
come to our house to make dishes. It was
very curious to see his proceedings; the beginning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>of all his dishes was the same, a large
piece of batter and a little flour; to this he
often added some bouillon. He was one day
going to make a small dish off a large dish
of cold roast beef. Instead of cutting off
a few slices, (before we saw what he was
about) he cut every bit of the beef to pieces,
and then broke the bones and threw them
into the <i>pot an feu</i>, to the great discomposure
of Carruthers. The French can make
a dish out of almost anything. One day he
began to tell us a long story about a place
where he used to dip the children, and to
show us what he meant he took little Caroline
in his arms and pretended to bathe her.
This cook was a true French figure; he used
to come in with his white nightcap and apron
on, and a sharp pointed knife hung by his
side. After scraping up the charcoal with his
fingers he used to dip two of them into the
pan, and putting them to his mouth he used
to say, 'Très bon, très bon.' He was, however,
a civil enough old man in his way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Another curious figure was our water-woman.
She was a remarkably ugly, vulgar-looking
old woman, and like all the old
French women, an immense size. She used
to wear a brown petticoat, a tattered apron,
and a knitted woollen body. Notwithstanding
her uncouth appearance, however, she
was by far the most polite old woman I saw
in France. Though upwards of seventy, she
one day sang us some songs very well.
When she came she used to make a curtsy
and enquire after us all in the civilest manner
possible. Indeed she was nearly the only
person whose manner was at all like what I
expected. Although one hears so much of
French politeness, I do not think that the
French are near so polite as the English.
The men make better bows, etc., but in
other things there is a kind of forwardness
in the manners of the people that I cannot
admire. If you are walking in the street
and a person happens to run against you
or hit you with his stick (which frequently
happens), he never thinks of saying anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>except calling out 'eh!' laughing, and
then walking on.</p>

<h4>MASTERS</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>May 21st.</i>&mdash;By this time we were sufficiently
settled to have some masters. The
dancing master who had been recommended
to us was Monsieur le Breton. I believe he
taught dancing very well in the French style
and took a good deal of pains, but he was not
a very agreeable master. The French dancing
is completely different from the English;
they think it beautiful to dance on the
flat of the foot and to bend every step, which
makes the dancing look very heavy: they do
not like jumping, although their steps are full
of little hops. Their tunes too are very dull.
The French in general do not admire the
English dancing; we were told, however,
of one English lady who had danced at the
balls, quite after the English fashion, and
whose dancing had been very much admired.
The constant cry of Monsieur Breton was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span><i>pliez, pliez</i>, and indeed part of the time we
danced on a stone floor so that we could dance
heavy enough to please him. He had expressions
like the rest of the French, such as
dancing, or working, 'like an angel,' etc. He
called the little ones Williaume, Henault,
and Coquette. Our dancing master had one
very disagreeable, though common French
trick; he used to spit so about the floor that
it was quite unpleasant to dance. He taught
six of us three times a week for six francs a
lesson. He had the smallest kit I ever saw.
He stayed two hours each time. Madame
Breton was a dressmaker. We tried her,
but she was by no means a good one. She
had three children, one of whom was an
idiot; and as three children in France are
reckoned a large family, she used always to
be complaining. The best dressmaker was
Mademoiselle Bouillet, Rue Charcelere. She
made our things very well; but towards the
last, when she found we were going away,
she hurried over the work without taking
the least pains, charging very dear for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>things, and quite spoiling others. She used
constantly to be promising us to send our
things, and as often breaking her promise.
She one day told us very coolly that we
might believe <i>her</i> promises, as she never
told lies; that her little girl was in the habit
of lying, but that it was not the case with
herself. Another day she told us it was not
her <i>nature</i> to tell lies, but her profession.
The French people do not seem to think it
wrong to cheat or lie, or the least disgraceful
to be told they do. Sometimes when we
thought anything we were buying dear, and
told the shopkeeper that we had bought the
same thing cheaper in another shop, she
answered, 'O madame, vous ne pouvez pas;
c'est impossible.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Monsieur Violet was our French master.
He was a good-humoured little man, and
spoke English very well. He generally wore
a green coat and light drab slippers; his hair
looked as if it had not been combed out for
a month: altogether he very much resembled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>an ape. He came for an hour every day,
and charged two francs a lesson.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Wragge had the best Italian master&mdash;-Monsieur
Pecci&mdash;in Europe (so they told
us). He charged a napoleon for twelve
lessons, whether she took them or not. He
was a dark, disagreeable-looking man. He
looked like one of the banditti.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We went to enquire about Monsieur Capan,
the drawing master (none of us, however,
went). He was finishing one very pretty
picture; but he seemed to have a great objection
to show us his drawings: he said it was
quite unnecessary for us to see them. His
pupils drew from busts, he said; they might
draw all day if they liked it, but that he
generally looked after them for an hour or
so in the middle of the day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We did not get any music master. The
general run of French pianos are not good.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>Madame Verny offered to sell us a harpsichord
for forty francs-certainly cheap
enough; but as half the notes were like a
pestle and mortar, and the other half would
not sound at all, we thought it would be
no acquisition.</p>


<h4>FUNERAL</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>May 23rd.</i>&mdash;As we expected French young
ladies to be very elegant, mamma was most
anxious that we should go as day scholars to
a French school; she thought, besides, that
it would be a change, as we were all sufficiently
tired of Versailles. We therefore
enquired of several people, and were told
that the pension of Madame Crosnier de
Varigny, Boulevard de la Reine, No. 55, was
the best at Versailles: they said it was not
indeed the largest, but the best and the most
select. We thought that so near the capital
there must be good schools; we therefore set
out this day to go and speak about it. In
our way, as we passed the Church of Notre
Dame, we observed it was all hung with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>black; we walked in, and enquired of some
people the cause. They answered, 'On va
faire un enterrement; c'est une dame forte à
son aise.' We walked round the church,
which is plain and dirty. A number of
priests, boys, and beggars went out to
meet the corpse with candles in their hands.
After waiting till we were almost tired, the
funeral at last made its appearance. There
first came in the beggars bearing lighted
candles in their hands; then a priest carrying
a crucifix; then a number of priests,
and boys that attend the priests, in black and
white; then two priests who held a sort of
black pipe, a serpent through which they
blew; after that came the coffin, covered
with white silk and bordered with black
velvet: it was placed on a bier elevated on a
platform covered with black near the altar.
A great many candles were lighted around
it. A priest chanted the whole way up the
church and during mass. Mass lasted half
an hour. After it was finished they made a
collection, after which the procession left the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>church in the same order as when it entered.
The old beggars also went out, taking their
candles along with them. There were forty
of them, the most frightfully ugly creatures
that can be imagined. Their skins were like
brown leather; they had on old patched petticoats;
they were blind and lame; one had a
nose as big as her face, and the next no nose
at all: they were altogether the most frightful
set I ever beheld. There were not many
people at the church, except some old women,
a number of whom are generally standing
about the churches. (Some of them take care
of the chairs. Every person that takes one
chair pays two liard, or on great fêtes two
sous.) These old women were likewise very
ugly. As the French women (except the
ladies) do not wear bonnets, their faces get
sunburnt, and the old women's skins look
like leather. Some grow excessively fat.
They wear a curious kind of cap, and generally
a red gown and a dark-blue apron with
pockets, and a kind of large chintz handkerchief.
After leaving the church we proceeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>to Madame Crosnier's. There were two or
three queerly-dressed, vulgar-looking girls
standing at the window. We were shown
up into a bedroom. Madame Crosnier is a
good-looking woman, genteel, and altogether
the nicest-looking woman I saw in France:
she had on a neat cotton gown (which is
more worn in France than in England) and
a pelerine. Mademoiselle Allemagne, her
<i>sous-maîtresse</i>, was not near so nice-looking.
The terms were for day-scholars, who did
not get their meals there, 10 francs a month,
drawing 10 francs, music 18 francs, harp 36,
dancing 9, and Italian 10 francs. School
hours were from nine to twelve, and from
one to three. Thursday was a half-holiday.
Madame Crosnier showed us some of the
young ladies' work: it was principally little
figures embroidered with coloured silks on
white silk. Catherine went to this school
the next day; Euphemia and I not till above
a fortnight after.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="p2"><i>May 25th.</i>&mdash;We took a walk in the forest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>It is full of paths, so that one might easily
lose one's way: the wood is very pretty. It
was evening when we walked in it, and we
saw one moth, the only one I saw in France,
except the cinnabars and some brown midges.
We met the King's gamekeeper, whom papa
spoke to: a little further on a drunken man
passed us: drunken people were by no means
a rare sight here, although we had been told
the contrary. When we got home it was
quite dark, and they were lighting the lamps,
which are hung on ropes stretched across
the street.</p>

<h4>ASCENSION</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>May 29th.</i>&mdash;This was Ascension Day, which
is a grand fête. We saw a long procession
of priests and soldiers, which I do not remember
very distinctly. After breakfast we
went to high mass at St. Louis, which we
were told was to be very grand. The priests
had on very fine dresses, gold, scarlet, silver,
purple, green, and all colours. It was quite
like some show; they changed places on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>steps and figured about as if they were waltzing.
The bishop had on a gold mitre; he
was dressed very splendidly. There was
a great deal of fine flourishing music.
The priests flung about the incense, and
the little boys dressed in white muslin
over red gowns rang little bells, on which
the people knelt down. We went to see
service again in the afternoon; it consisted
of nothing but loud music like a waltz tune.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
I missed the prettiest sight, which was seeing
a lady make the <i>quête</i> or collection for the
poor. The lady sat before the altar; she had
on a white gauze gown, and a veil which
hung down behind fastened round her head
with a wreath of roses. She had on white
gloves and shoes, and was dressed as if she
was going to a ball. An officer handed her
about, and the concierge went before, knocking
on the ground with his stick. (The
concierge is generally a very tall man dressed
in plum colour; he goes before the priests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>funerals, etc.) The lady held in her hand
a little box of crimson velvet and gold which
she presented to everybody, and curtsied;
a servant followed with a crimson bag, into
which she emptied the money when the box
was full. The French churches are just like
some show. We were told that a French
gentleman had stayed at the English chapel
one Sunday during the sacrament; he said
he was very much struck with the stillness
and solemnity, 'avec nous c'est tout comédie.'
In the afternoon, before service began, we observed
a very poor, miserable-looking man
sitting with a money-box before him, and at
one side a shell full of holy water (which we
did not at first observe). Miss Wragge,
thinking he was a miserable object, as she
passed dropped a sou into his box; which no
sooner had she done than he dipped a little
mop which he held in his hand into the
holy water, and sprinkled it over her face.
This set some women who were kneeling
down a-laughing. After mass we saw the
rooms of the palace; they were very magnificent,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>but I had a much better view of them
some time afterwards.</p>

<h4>NANNETTE</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>May 29th.</i>&mdash;As we rather wanted some
person to assist our servants, Nannette, the
German servant we had at Passy, was sent
for. She was most useful in going messages,
as she would run all day; several people said
they were sure she was not a French woman,
she was so active. She, however, had most
of the French habits; if she was making a
bed, or doing anything else, if she heard
anything, down went her work and off she
went to see what was the matter. She never
could do without going to <i>promener</i> in the
evening, and going for a day up to Paris
once every week. Nannette also copied the
French in eating; besides taking the same
meals as our other servants, she used to be
continually eating at odd times. Sometimes
she cooked herself some <i>potage</i>, or else she
asked for <i>pain</i> and <i>quelque chose</i>; one day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>she eat half a tureen of cold sorrel soup soon
after breakfast; and frequently cold meat and
bread. Besides all this, she never went out
without buying herself fruit. Her language
was a strange mixture of French, English,
and German. She hated the French, and
used to be very rude to them: they in return
could not bear her; they used to call her a
Prussian. Our dancing master once said, 'La
Prusse est la plus vile de toutes les nations
de l'Europe.' If Nannette cleaned a room,
she used to throw a pail of water over the
floor till the water ran into the passage.
The French say themselves, that nothing
has spoiled the servants like the Revolution:
if anything offends them they will go off;
and frequently choose to leave you when you
have company, or some time when you most
want them.</p>


<h3>June 1821</h3>

<h4>HEAT</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 1st.</i>&mdash;This day was excessively hot:
the heat lasted just three days.</p>

<h4>WATERWORKS</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 3rd.</i>&mdash;In the morning we were informed
by the porter's wife that the waters
were to play. In the afternoon we accordingly
walked in the palace garden, and were
very glad to find it was the case. The
gardens were very full, as a great many
people had come from Paris to see the waters
play. Some of the large waterworks did not
play, such as Neptune's Bath; and some of
the others only partly. Latona's basin was
beautiful; it was playing very little at first,
but while we were looking at it all the frogs
began to spout water, which formed a bower
of water over Latona's head, and covered her
and her children. The frogs, lizards, etc., at
the bottom, spouted water the contrary way,
which did not look so well. In the same
basin at each side were two pipes, which
sent out a column of water. Apollo's Bath
was playing a little out of the horses' mouths.
Two smaller pieces of water had a very good
effect: in the middle was a <i>jet d'eau</i>; on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>each side of one was a lion tearing a wolf,
and another lion killing a wild boar; on the
other was a tiger tearing a bear, and a blood-hound
killing a stag&mdash;out of the mouths of
these figures came streams of water. The
figures are bronze. One of the large waterworks,
called Le Basin de l'Obélisque, consists
of a number of pipes in imitation of reeds in
the middle of the basin, which send out
a column of water to the height of 75
feet: this waterwork was playing very little
when we were there&mdash;it appeared like a
basket of froth. Some of the smaller waters
are quite as pretty as the large ones: one
represents Ceres seated on some sheaves and
surrounded by children. Another, a number
of children, some holding masks, shells, and
one a pair of bellows. The one that I liked
best was a small basin, in the middle of
which there is a little island which appears
to be made of bronze: on this are six little
children playing with flowers, and one on
each side which seems to swim or float. Out
of the island rises a column of water. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>waters looked particularly pretty among the
trees. There were a great many people in
the gardens, and the variety of colours resembled
a bed of tulips. Some of the people
were very oddly dressed. One woman had
on a most extraordinary cap composed of
pink satin and very pretty lace; she had a
gold chain round her neck, a white gown,
and pink cotton apron. (Her cap was not at
all common.) The French are very fond of
colours, and put them on with very bad taste.
We saw some people with perhaps a pink
handkerchief, a blue sash, a coarse cotton
gown, a yellow bonnet, and green shoes. We
saw one lady in church with a yellow bonnet
spotted with every colour; and another lady
with one side of her bonnet one colour, and
the other another colour. The ladies are in
general very plain. We were told that a lady
having tried to persuade an English gentleman
that the French ladies were pretty, he
took her to one of the great waterworks,
where she could see ten thousand people, and
told her that he would give her a gown worth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>five hundred francs if she could find three
handsome women. The lady tried, but was
obliged to acknowledge that she could not.
The French women have not good figures:
the old women are very fat, and the others
are as flat as two boards.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Many of the ladies
were attended by <i>bonnes</i>, some of whom were
dressed more neatly than the French women
generally are:&mdash;with light cotton gowns,
muslin handkerchiefs, and caps trimmed with
lace over blue or pink paper. The children
that were with them were queer-looking
little things. The French children are old-fashioned,
dull, grave, and ugly: like little
old women in their appearance. The babies
are wrapt up in swaddling-clothes like mummies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>and they wear queer little cotton hats.
The nurses carry them very carefully hanging
on their arms; they say that nursing
them, or tossing them about, makes them
mad. Some of the children have long hair
hanging down their backs and little hats
stuck on the tops of their heads and little
ridicules in their hands. We stayed in the
gardens this evening later than usual looking
at the waters, which from the terrace
had a very pretty effect.</p>

<h4>COLD</h4>

<p><i>June	4th.</i>&mdash;Our long-expected and much-dreaded
hot weather has never arrived, but
instead of it cold, wet weather. The French
said it was an unusually bad season; they
were quite <i>en colère</i>. It was this day quite
a storm; from the quantity of rain which had
fallen there was a little canal before the door;
and as the dining-room was across the yard,
we could hardly get to it in wet weather
without getting our feet wet. I never felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>anything so cold as it was in France. We
used to sit shivering, wrapt up in shawls to
try and keep ourselves warm. There were
no grates; the fire was lighted on the hearth
between two dogs, and we used to sit round
it blowing the wood to try and make it
burn: to make matters worse there were two
holes, one on each side of the fireplace,
apparently made to let the smoke into the
room; these we were obliged to stuff with
paper. It was as bad in bed, and though we
had sent repeatedly, we could not get any
quilts and only one cotton blanket to each
bed. There were no carpets in the rooms;
only bare stone floors, from which, besides
being very cold, all the red came off on to
our gowns. We were most of us sufficiently
tired of France. I would have given anything
in the world to get back to England,
but we thought there was no chance of that
for a long time. Every person was dismal:
one got the rheumatism, another had a cold,
another was ill, another had chilblains, and
another was melancholy; and all said they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>would not grumble if they did not see other
people grumble. I went from room to room,
and could get no consolation. In spite of
their spectacles and processions, there was a
dulness in the streets and a want of life in
the people: everything seemed to be creeping
along and looking like oysters. The boys
amused themselves with a swing; when the
soldiers were exercising they used sometimes
to look in at the garden gate to watch them.
The servants were very dismal: they used
often to say how much they had been
mistaken in France, and what fine stories
they would tell about it when they got back
to Cumberland.</p>


<h4>FRENCH SCHOOL</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 11th.</i>&mdash;This day Euphemia and I
went for the first time to Madame Crosnier's.
Catherine had gone for some time, and given
us a very strange account of it; but notwithstanding
all she had said, it was far worse
than we had expected. There were twelve or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>fourteen English girls, three Miss Stephens
whom we had formerly seen at Bath, where
they did not look at all nice&mdash;they were here
very well dressed and genteel-looking; Miss
Fuller, a daughter of General Fuller, who had
a French mamma, a complete little dandy;
Miss Fitzgerald, who was a little plague;
Miss Molyneux, a nice little girl who had
been left there; Miss Julia Carpenter, and
several others. The nicest were two Miss
Wergs. The eldest was scarcely nine years
old. They were sweet, pretty little girls,
with good colours; they were a great contrast
to the French girls beside them. Ellen
Werg told me that they had come to France
for their education, and that their papa liked
it so much that they were never going home
again; but that they and their mamma hated
it. They used sometimes to cry when they
heard the other girls talk of going home, and
say, 'Oh, I wish I was going too!' We used
often to see them at church; their papa was
very crabbed-looking. They could not speak
a word of French: they left school about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>same time as I did without knowing a word
more than when they came. Their mamma
said it was such a ruinous school they should
stay no longer. The French girls were the
dirtiest, rudest set I ever saw. They wore
very coarse dark cotton frocks or black petticoats,
dirty blue or red aprons with pockets,
spotted with ink, black worsted stockings,
and listen shoes. Some of them had large
bunches of keys hung by their sides, and
others sashes and braces of broad scarlet
galloon. One girl&mdash;Mademoiselle Rose&mdash;was
so dirty, that even Madame Crosnier used
to speak to her about it. She had on an old
cotton frock bedaubed with ink, that did not
meet by three or four inches; through the
gap one saw a pair of dirty stays and an old
striped worsted petticoat, and on the top of
a frock there was a gauze frill hanging in
rags. Her hair was matted with dirt. Some
of the girls had pieces of green glass in their
ears for earrings, black velvet round their
head, and gilt combs with the teeth broken
out stuck in their dirty, black, uncombed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>hair, which hung over their faces. Their
skins were dirty and yellow. The neatest
of these young ladies was a Mademoiselle
Sélina&mdash;who was conceited-looking, and
Mademoiselle Joséphine. The girls' manners
were as elegant as themselves&mdash;they called
each other names, and used the most vulgar
words. If in school-time any of them were
speaking, and their teacher reproved them,
they answered, 'Vous mentez, Mademoiselle,
vous êtes menteuse, je ne parle pas.' Indeed,
if they were doing a thing all the time they
were spoken to, they did not scruple to say
they were not. There were, beside Madame
Crosnier, Mademoiselle Allemagne, the first
teacher; Mademoiselle Croissé, the drawing
mistress, who also taught in the schoolroom;
and Annette, a kind of half teacher, who had
been one of the <i>young ladies</i>. I certainly
never saw an English kitchen-maid dressed
in the way she was. A dirty cap without
a border, a black petticoat, a coarse blue
gown tucked up like a bed-gown, a very
coarse kind of linen apron, and shoes down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>at the heels, completed her dress. She used
to go about with a broom sweeping the
rooms. The girls took it by turns to clean
the schoolrooms once every week. They
used to tuck up their frocks, sweep the dirt
into the <i>cabinet noir</i> (or closet into which
the litters were swept), and then throw a pail
of water on the floor and mop it up. Miss
Stephens used to call it her <i>malheureuse
semaine</i>. The first morning we went earlier
than usual, school had not begun, and a
number of dirty girls were sitting or rather
lying on the floor about the passages, looking
like a set of gypsies. We went upstairs to
the <i>salle de dessin</i>. Mademoiselle Croissé
taught drawing. She was tall and sallow,
and was reckoned pretty. She had a pair of
staring black eyes, and a great deal of long
black hair, which she seemed to admire very
much, and used to bring in pieces of butter
in a curl-paper and grease it beside us. She
had done two very pretty drawings, which
she kept to show. We sat down to our
drawing. Mademoiselle Croissé drew us an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>eye for a copy and left us; we might do it or
not, just as we pleased, she never looked near
us. Little Miss Fitzgerald had been learning
drawing for a great many months, but she
had only drawn two or three sheets full all
the time. Nearly every day that I was there
she did not even get out her paper, but sat
playing, talking, or running out of the room.
Mademoiselle Croissé used sometimes to
stand at the window, and if she happened to
see a cat, she had such a dislike to the sight
of cats that she was obliged to send one of
the girls from their drawing to drive these
animals away. At other times she was out
of the room, or employed with her own drawing,
so that she had hardly time to tell us
how our drawings looked when we had done
them. Once when we had just settled to our
drawings (Mademoiselle Croissé absent as
usual), in came two of the maids&mdash;'Mademoiselle,
il faut sortir, car je vais baller la
chambre'; we were therefore obliged to
decamp. The servants were the rudest set
I ever saw. Catherine had a music mistress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>Mademoiselle Pascal; but she begged to have
her no longer. One of the pianos would
hardly sound, and they had no additional
keys. The mistress did not seem to understand
music very well, and she used to like
heavy playing. I do not think it is any
credit in the French masters being cheap;
at least, from the specimens we saw here they
got their money very easily. Monsieur le
Chevalier, the writing master, came once or
twice a week; he used to sit down at one
end of the table, and never move; he had a
curious squeaking voice. I could never find
out what he did except mending pens, and
those were so bad that we were obliged to
get Madame Crosnier to mend them afterwards;-she
also gave us the copies: he
never saw what I had written the whole time.
Euphemia one day said to one of the English
girls, 'Pray, is that man sitting there, mending
pens, called a writing master?' As for
the dancing, it was quite a farce. We heard
a great deal about the <i>salle de danse</i>, so we
imagined it to be quite a fine place; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>what did this beautiful <i>salle</i> turn out to be,
but a passage leading to the schoolroom, in
which we hung up our hats, etc. There was
not a chair in the place. It was to my
astonishment that they could dance at all
in such a hole as it was. Monsieur Bréton
taught here. The girls dressed in the same
elegant dresses as they generally wore, and
we used often to hear them laughing, crying,
and romping. Of course we did not
learn.</p>


<h4>FRENCH SCHOOL</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 11th.</i>&mdash;After we had finished drawing,
we went downstairs into the schoolroom.
It was a long room; in it there were two
tables, which seemed originally to have been
white, but they were now almost black with
ink-stains and dirt; at the top of one of the
tables sat Madame Crosnier, and at the other
Mademoiselle Allemagne. We none of us
did anything but write and copy one another's
writings; Madame Crosnier sat reading the
newspapers, every now and then looking up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>and saying 'travaillez,' or 'paix.' The girls
stained all their frocks and aprons with ink;
if the rulers were inky they wiped them on
their aprons, and if there were not inkstands
enough, they had a very short expedient;
they made an inkstand of the table, by pouring
some ink on it into which they dipped
their pens. The paper of the room was torn
off, so that in many places one could see the
canvas that covered the walls. Round the
room were hung several maps, which looked
as if they had been nibbled away by mice.
The girls jumped over the stools, spirted ink
at one another, tossed about the books, and
danced upon the tables;<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> it did not seem to
be in the teachers' power to make them be
quiet, though they sometimes gave them
verses to write; but the most common punishment
was either making them kneel down
(which the girls seemed to think good fun),
or else sending for the <i>bonnet de nuit</i>, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>they put on and laughed. Soon after we
had come down, one of the girls brought in
Madame Crosnier's breakfast. She used to
have such a variety; one day fish, another
asparagus and oil, another dressed eggs,
another pease, another minced beef, etc.,
along with this she had bread, and wine and
water; and afterwards she had a cup of coffee
and some more bread, so that she did very
well. Soon after Madame Crosnier had
finished her breakfast, they had prayers;
the girls knelt down, while one of them
gabbled over a prayer as quick as she could;
the only words we could distinguish were,
'C'est ma faute, c'est ma faute, c'est ma
grande faute, par St. Jean, et St. Paul, et
St. Pierre' (then all the French girls crossed
themselves). Madame Crosnier and Mademoiselle
Allemagne very seldom knelt down;
they used to be employed mending pens
or correcting exercises. After prayers were
finished, the girls got up and wrote as before.
Madame Crosnier's two children used to
come running in, or squealing at the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>most of school-time. The youngest was
quite an infant, a miserable-looking little
thing, wrapt up in a woollen cloth, daubed
with dirt: the servants used to sit in the
kitchen with it on their knees, and stuff its
mouth full of curd. The other child was
liked by some of the girls, but I thought it
a most disagreeable little brat: it had on a
dirty, ragged, little brown pinafore, and its
face looked as if it was never washed. At
twelve o'clock Madame Crosnier rang a bell,
and then all the girls left off school, and
went into the luncheon-room. The day-scholars
brought their own luncheon, mostly
bread and cherries, and capillaire or sorbet
to drink; two little French girls brought a
bottle of wine, or wine and water, which they
drank <i>between</i> them. Those that did not
bring their luncheon got the sour French
bread and curds, or apples. Mademoiselle
Allemagne or Mademoiselle Croissé helped
the luncheon. The girls used to eat one,
and sometimes two, half slices off the flat
loaves a foot in breadth, cut very thick, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>sour curd as thick as the bread; the girls
used to take dirty knives out of their pockets
and spread the curd on the bread. The
English girls told us that they got for breakfast,
broth or radishes, or apples and bread;
for dinner, <i>bouilli</i> or roast mutton, and instead
of pudding, vegetables dressed with
butter; and for supper nearly the same as at
luncheon. After luncheon they used to go
into the garden (which was more like a wilderness)
and skip or run, or sit and talk, or else
they used to amuse themselves in the house,
in making little baskets, fishes, crosses, birds,
etc., of beads; which was very agreeable
work.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> At one o'clock the bell rang again,
and we employed ourselves much the same
as in the morning, till two o'clock, when
school was over. Annette taught in a different
room, principally the little ones. We
once looked in: all the little girls were sitting
dawdling and scribbling round the table up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>to their elbows in ink; Annette was walking
round rapping the table with a short ruler
and saying 'travaillez, travaillez.' The
youngest of her scholars, who was only five
years old, used to walk up and down the
passages most of schooltime, and if any of
the English girls spoke to her she used to
say, 'Moitié Anglaise, moitié Anglaise.' She
could, however, speak nothing but French.
Notwithstanding the number of English,
not one of the French girls could speak
a word of English except Mademoiselle
Selina, who used to say 'Good nih, good
morning.'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>We were altogether very much astonished
at this <i>genteel</i> and select school; if I had
not seen it, I could not have thought it possible
for the girls to be specimens of French
young ladies. I only attended a month, and
though, at first, it was a change, I was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>sorry to leave such a dirty, disagreeable place.
Catherine and Euphemia were ill, and therefore
stayed a much shorter time. Madame
Crosnier's fête was some months after. I
was told that on her fête she gave a ball
and supper, to which she invited (besides her
own friends) all the young ladies and their
parents. One English girl said if she might
she would have no wish to come, for she
knew they would get nothing but scraps to
eat and sugar and water to drink.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Before
the fête it is the custom to give Madame
Crosnier a present. One year they gave her
a gown, another year a carpet, and this year
it was to be a clock. Each of the girls
subscribed ten francs or 8s. 4d., and some
of the little ones six francs. They also
gave a drawing or some present of their
own. At Christmas they each gave a pound
of tea or sugar, or a pair of gloves or some
other thing.</p>

<div class="caption">FRENCH MILLER</div>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>Before the girls took their <i>première communion</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>(which they take as soon as they are
ten years old) Madame Crosnier instructed
them a great deal on their catechism, etc.;
they did not come down or speak to any of
the other girls for a week before.</p>

<p>Near the stables there were several girls
who used to beg from every person they met;
two were quite rude. As we went we used
to see people sitting out of doors getting
their breakfasts or dinners. They seemed to
have very curious messes: bread and fruit,
broth, and porringers of preserves into which
they dipt their bread, for dinner. On one
bench we generally used to see a number of
millers<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> sitting getting their breakfast, with
a very long roll and a knife in their hands,
and a bottle of <i>vin ordinaire</i> beside them.</p>


<h4>RUDE BOY</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 14th.</i>&mdash;We had been with Carruthers
to the market, and after she had bought her
things, as there were more than she could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>carry, she got a boy (of whom there were
plenty ready) to carry some of her goods
home for her. When we reached home she
paid him the common price, but to our
surprise he refused to take it unless he could
get a great deal more; she then offered him
some meat and bread besides the money, but
this he also refused unless he might carry
away the plate; and to try and frighten
Carruthers he said he would go and bring
the commissaire. After remaining for a
quarter of an hour the porter's wife came in,
and after scolding him for some time she at
last obliged him to take the money (which
she said was more than was usually given)
and the meat and go away, which he did,
abusing Carruthers all the way. This was
one of the boys who used to point at us on
our way to school.</p>


<h4>TRIP TO PARIS</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 15th.</i>&mdash;I this day went to Paris with
mamma and papa: papa had been staying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>there for a few days. We had a very pleasant
ride, and reached the Hôtel du Mont
Blanc, Rue de la Paix, where papa had been
before. This street is one of the best in
Paris; there are footpaths at the sides, and
the boulevards run along the bottom. We
walked along the boulevards under the rows
of trees; at one side there are the Chinese
baths, the outsides of which are curiously
ornamented with artificial rocks and figures
holding umbrellas, etc. There seemed to be
a great many people idling about. There
was a man with a canary in a kind of moss
bower; the bird was so tame as to sit still
without attempting to fly away. There was
another man with a tame hedgehog, which
he held up in his hand to the people; it
seemed to be playing tricks. We went
through the Passage des Panoramas, where
we bought a bunch of clear beads for five sous,
a sou dearer than at Versailles. We afterwards
went to the Palais Royal, where they
asked eight sous a bunch: the shops in the
Palais Royal are very dear and disagreeable.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>There were some curious things at
the windows.</p>


<h4>FLOWER MARKET&mdash;TIVOLI, ETC.</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 16th.</i>&mdash;A very fine day. After breakfast
we went in a coach to the flower-market.
We walked down it: the women had on large
straw hats. There were rows of flower-pots
down each side, the prettiest collection I
ever saw. There were roses, carnations,
myrtles, beautiful campanulas, geraniums,
Madagascar periwinkles, etc.: there were
also strawberries, currant, apple and orange
trees, all in pots. The apple-trees were a
a very small kind, the branches of which
were covered with fruit; there were likewise
little oranges on the orange-trees. From
this we drove to the Church of St. Sulpice.
There is a picture over the altar on which
the light falls from the top. There was a
wedding going on in it when we entered.
They were a curious-looking pair that were
married. I was not near enough to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>plainly what the priest was doing, but when
the ceremony was over he passed close by us
muttering to himself all the way; he was
dressed very finely, but he was the most
horrid-looking old man I ever saw; he
reminded us of the Inquisition and everything
horrible.</p>

<p>Near the church is the Fontaine de St.
Sulpice; it is a very plain little fountain.
From this we went to Notre Dame, where
we saw the end of a christening. After that
we went to the Fontaine des Innocents;
it is a large, high fountain, with several
lions' heads, which were not playing when
we saw it. From this we drove to Tivoli.
In going to it we passed through the narrowest
streets I was ever in. I do not think
two carriages could possibly have passed.
They were very dirty and close, and had
such disagreeable smells; I was not sorry
to get through them. We got out at Tivoli,
and walked under a kind of trellis-work up
to the house where you pay. Tivoli is not
near so nice, or so large as Sydney Gardens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>at Bath. There are several winding walks
bordered with Austrian roses, box, etc.
There are a great number of swings and
roundabouts of ships, swans, and horses.
We saw a man playing at a kind of game;
to a long wooden box was fastened a string
with a wooden bird at the end of it; he threw
it so as to fire a pistol, and then Cupid came
out of the top. At one part of the garden
there is a steep hill; at the top is a temple,
and near the bottom a sort of grotto; at the
top are kinds of carriages, and whoever
wants to ride down gets into one; they slide
in grooves down the hill and under the
grotto. I should think it would be a frightful
thing. After we had walked over the
garden we went into a café and got some
cakes and wine. We then left Tivoli and
walked up to Montmartre; it is very steep
up to it, but when one gets to the top near
some windmills one has a view of the
whole of Paris and the country round it,
quite like a panorama. On our way home
we stopped at several shops to buy a cap; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>they asked us very dear, and had nothing
particularly nice. At some shops there is
written 'English spoken here,' and on one
'English <i>spiked</i> here.' It requires a great
deal of bargaining to get things for a right
price. At some shops there is written 'prix
fixe.' The people in the shops are remarkably
plain, and plainly dressed.</p>

<h4>SUNDAY</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 17th.</i>&mdash;No sooner were we out of
bed than there came several men before our
windows, and played tunes. One man came
into the street with a fiddle, which he played
on, made grimaces, and jumped about as if
he were crazy. He was a most extraordinary-looking
creature; he was dressed like a
merry-andrew, with a white wig and a queue
on his head; if one had seen him in England
one would have thought he was mad.
While he was capering about, another man
came into the street with a puppet-show; he
put a table on the ground, and made first
some men and women, and then a carriage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>go round it<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> In the middle of the day we
walked in the gardens of the Tuileries,
which were excessively crowded, and through
the square of the Louvre. It is the most
beautiful thing of the kind I ever saw; I
think it is a much more magnificent palace
than that of Versailles. It is beautifully
carved round every window and door, and
excessively white and clean-looking. I altogether
admired this palace, and the Colonne
de la Place Vendôme, the most of any of the
buildings in Paris. In the evening I walked
with papa on the boulevards as far as the
Fontaine de Bondy, which was not playing.
It was dark when we came back, and the
boulevards were crowded with people. The
cafés were lighted up, and were full of people
sitting taking refreshments. There were stalls
like a fair, puppet-shows, and conjurers. I
never saw anything so unlike Sunday.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<h4>LUXEMBOURG-MAN AND STILTS, ETC.</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 18th.</i>&mdash;We went to the Palais Royal
(on our way we bought a souvenir). I wanted
some little remembrance of France: we went
into several shops in the Palais Royal, and
the cheapest thing I could get there was
a little gilt cart and horse, for which the
woman asked ten francs. We, however, got
it for eight, which was far too much, as we
got as pretty a one in the Rue de la Paix for
half the price; we also got some silk winders
of mother-of-pearl. The shops in the Palais
Royal are very dear and disagreeable: the
people seem to make quite a favour of selling
you anything.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Near this we got some
strawberries and cream in a café (Véfours).
After that we drove to the Luxembourg. We
walked in the gardens, which are <i>very</i> formal,
but pretty in their way; there are a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>many flowers and roses growing out of the
banks of grass. There are a few basins of
water, and a great number of statues. We
did not see the inside of the palace. As we
were returning we saw the King in his coach
a good way before us; he had a great many
attendants with him. In the afternoon we
dined at Major Cape's. Most of the party
liked France very much. Just before we
went there we saw a crowd in the street, and
after looking a little while we observed a
man dressed up in scarlet <i>à la</i> Henri Quatre,
with a feather in his hat, on horseback. He
rode up and down, and seemed to be making
a speech. The people then made a large
circle round him, and three little boys and
a girl who were with him, dressed up like
merry-andrews, got on stilts, and marched
and danced before him. The man then got
off his horse, and got on stilts; the man and
the children were on stilts so as to make
them the same height, so that the least, who
did not look above five or six years old, must
have been more than a yard from the ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>They all took hold of hands, waltzed, <i>sauteused</i>,
ran under each other's arms, and
danced a fine figure-dance. The man did
the worst. They danced to the beating of a
drum; the little one curtsied on his stilts,
and after they had done, the man put him
on the horse, and sent him round to collect
money. We stayed very late at Major
Cape's; and I was glad to go to bed when
we came in.</p>


<h4>RETURN TO VERSAILLES</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 19th.</i>&mdash;This was the last day I was
to stay in Paris, for which I was very sorry,
as I liked being in Paris a great deal better
than in Versailles. There are some very
amusing things in Paris, though I do not
think it is to be compared to London. We
expected Miss Wragge and brothers and
sisters to see the museum, which we had
been long promised. Miss Wragge, Barbara,
the two boys, and Caroline came just after
we had finished breakfast; but Catherine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>and Euphemia were so ill they could not
come. (Catherine was not well when we
came to Paris, but we hoped by this time
she would have been better.) After they had
come we bought some gilt gigs, baskets, etc.,
in a <i>very</i> cheap, <i>civil</i> shop in the Rue de la
Paix, where there were a great many little
ornaments. We also bought some silk shoes
at a good shop near. After we came in, Mr.
and Mrs. Fisher called. We did not go to
the museum, but went instead to the Louvre,
where we had a longer view of the pictures
than before; I did not like them better this
time than when I first saw them. There
were several Quakers in the Louvre; we saw
some in the streets of Paris at different times.
As soon as we came back from the Louvre
we returned to Versailles. On our way we
saw the Duchesse d'Angoulême in an open
carriage. When we reached the Avenue
de Sceaux we found Catherine <i>very</i> ill, and
Euphemia not at all well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<h4>COMMUNION</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 20th.</i>&mdash;Before breakfast we went to
see the girls and boys take their <i>première
communion</i> at Notre Dame. The church was
so full we could hardly get near to see them.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
The first set of young ladies that came in
were dressed in white muslin frocks trimmed
with lace and satin, white sashes, gloves, shoes,
and ridicules, lace and white satin caps, and
lace or muslin veils; the next set were dressed
in the same way with pink sashes; the third
set blue; the fourth set green; and the two
next sets white. After that came a school
of girls dressed in buff cotton frocks and
common muslin veils, who seemed to be
poor girls: several nuns sat with them.
Another set had on thick white frocks. All
the girls sat in a seat by themselves. The
boys had bows of white ribbon on their arms.
Madame Crosnier's school was very smart
with white sashes like the others; those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>her girls who did not take their communion
were dressed in neat white frocks, scarlet
sashes, and Leghorn bonnets. Madame Crosnier
and her teachers were very nicely dressed.
The girls had every advantage that dress
could give them; but we could not help remarking
how very different a set of English
girls would look to those with their dingy
complexions. They had candles in their
hands, which they lighted and blew out
several times during mass. Some of the
candles were very much ornamented with
gold paper, etc.; one had a little gilt basket
filled with flowers round it, and others lyres
on them. I thought there was a great chance
of the girls setting fire to each other as they
sat close together. While we were in the
church there were two women with a little
child beside us, which squalled and fretted the
whole time. It first would have one thing,
and then another. The women managed it
excessively stupidly; they first gave it a
cake, then snatched it away from it, then
whipped it, then kissed it; and they looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>at each other as much as to say it is impossible
to make it be quiet. The French
children are little petted, disagreeable, spoiled
things; they say that it hurts their health to
find fault with them.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> They are very dirty,
and their heads are covered with a cap of
dirt which they call the <i>Écaille du bon Dieu</i>,
and it is reckoned a kind of sacrilege to take
it off. Even the highest ranks of people do
not comb their children's hair till they are
two years old, that they may be covered with
this cap of dirt, which, they say, prevents
them having sore eyes and makes them cut
their teeth easily. Another prejudice that
they have is that nursing and tossing the
children about makes them mad; the doctors
say that it is only the dull air of <i>England</i>
that requires it:<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> some of them say that it
is that which causes so many mad people
in England. The consequence is that the
French babies are dull, heavy, and stupid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>We were obliged to leave the church to go
to breakfast, so we missed seeing the girls
take the sacrament, which they take on their
tongues and eat whole without breaking it.
After they had done we saw them go home;
Madame Crosnier's school went in a coach.
In the evening we went again to Notre Dame,
where one of the priests preached a sermon
to the boys and girls that had taken the
sacrament, and told them to prepare for
being confirmed the next morning. After
the sermon was finished they walked in procession
round the inside of the church, the
girls first and the boys after, with lighted
candles in their hands. Some of the candles
were so much broken that they could hardly
hold them upright. One or two of the girls
did not look more than six or seven years
old: we supposed that they had not been
taking the communion, but were only walking
in the procession. It was altogether a pretty
sight. After they had walked round the
church they all went home. When they
receive their <i>première communion</i> it is customary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>to give the priest something: this
time they gave a clock.</p>


<h4>TREE BURNT DOWN</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 23rd.</i>&mdash;This day is the fête of St. Jean.
We were told that in the evening there was
to be a tree burnt down opposite the palace.
Accordingly Miss Wragge, brothers, and
some of the servants, went to see the ceremony.
A tree was fixed up round which
were tied bundles of straw and faggots, and
a guard stood round it. The son of the
governor of the château came out in great
style, attended by several servants, with a
torch in his hand; he set fire to the tree, and
the people tried to pull away the faggots as
they were burning. The whole party gave
me a very poor account of it. The servants
said they could not think what made the
people make such a fuss about seeing a bit
of a tree burnt down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h4>FÊTE DIEU</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 24th.</i>&mdash;This was the <i>Fête Dieu</i>, a
grand fête day in France. Soldiers and
priests were passing all the morning. There
was a procession at eight o'clock, which I did
not see. At half-past eleven we went to the
Avenue de St. Cloud, where we were told
the procession would pass. There were a
<i>very</i> great number of people, amongst others
our porter's wife, who ran to get near the
procession that the priests might touch her
baby. We stood near Madame Crosnier's
school; the girls (except Mademoiselle Rose,
who was much as usual) were neatly dressed.
There were soldiers along each side of the
avenue. We were amused at several women
who tried to run quickly across before the
procession. After we had waited for a long
time the procession at last came:&mdash;1st, three
men on horseback; 2nd, a man in a red
gown trimmed with fur, who carried a large
red flag&mdash;two boys held the strings; 3rd, a
man in purple who held a purple flag&mdash;two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>boys held the strings; 4th, a priest with a
red flag&mdash;two priests held the strings; 5th,
pioneers and a band of music; 6th, priests
singing; 7th, a number of priests with books
and crosses, and a concierge; 8th, priests
with censors full of incense, and baskets full
of flower-leaves;<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> 9th, several priests holding
a crimson velvet canopy, under which
was the Bishop of Versailles, an old man of
eighty-four. A number of pages dressed in
coats embroidered with gold, fleurs-de-lys,
etc., and a number of officers, closed the procession.
Along each side of the avenue there
walked the boys and girls who had taken
their <i>première communion</i>, dressed as before.
The girls walked on one side and the boys
on the other. One of the girls was dressed
in white silk and a blue and gold mantle,
with long hair over her face and back. We
were told that this little girl was dedicated
to the Virgin; she was a very curious-looking
figure. Several nuns walked with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>girls. After them, along each side, there
walked a number of priests in very brilliant
dresses, gold, red, and green, etc. Besides
these there were priests in different parts of
the procession. Every now and then the
procession stopped, and the priests that went
before the bishop turned round and threw
incense and flowers, which looked very
pretty.</p>

<p>After the procession had passed, we went
to see the <i>reposoir</i> of the Lyceum, which
we were told was the prettiest. It is a building
like a temple. The doors were shut, but
a very civil, gentlemanly-looking person let
us go in. The pillars were hung with wreaths
of green, and there were rows of trees in
boxes up the middle, cut like those in the
gardens. The altar was a good deal ornamented:
there were golden candlesticks, artificial
flowers, etc., on it. They were putting
away the things while we were there. The
person who let us in said it was customary
to give away the flowers; we got two or
three, which were all that were left. Before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>the <i>reposoir</i> there was grass laid for the
priests to kneel upon; we saw some women
picking it up. There was another <i>reposoir</i>
in the Avenue de Berri, and one near us at
the end of the Avenue de Sceaux, which was
made slightly up, out of doors. There were
flower-pots on the sides, and a cross of lilies
and roses on the top. The children had
dressed up little chapels on tables against
the wall, in the streets, with little figures,
vials full of flowers, coloured paper, etc. As
people went by they came to beg 'pour la
petite chapelle.' One girl who came was
quite a monster: she had no nose, and
two teeth that stuck out of her mouth like
tusks. Out of some of the windows in
the streets were hung pieces of tapestry and
old carpets.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>June 26th.</i>&mdash;Catherine was now extremely
ill; indeed, no person seemed very well. What
with the cold, and one thing and another, we
grew more dismal than ever. This day papa
told us for our comfort (for the first time)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>that as soon as Catherine was able we should
all go home. This piece of intelligence made
us all happy for a short time, as it was what
we did not at all expect. I cannot tell what
made me dislike France so very much; one
reason I think was that I raised my expectations
too high. I had heard so much of the
fine climate, the excellent fruit, and the lively
people, that I was quite disappointed at the
cold weather, the bad fruit,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and the dull
people. Besides, I felt so far away from
home that I grew quite unhappy. Nothing
seemed agreeable; I was tired of the gardens
and the processions. My greatest amusement
was a little rose-tree that died soon
after I got it. In the morning when I got
up, the only thing I wished was that the day
was over, and that we had a day less to stay
at Versailles. The family that had lived
above us was now gone. Miss Ward and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>Miss Johnson&mdash;two Irish ladies, with Mab,
their French servant&mdash;now inhabited that
part of the house. They had come to France
on account of being ill. They were remarkably
civil in sending down 'comed-milk,'<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
fruit, or anything else they thought Catherine
might like.</p>


<h4>BAKER</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 28th.</i>&mdash;Carruthers saw our bread-baker
standing at the street door talking to
some women, with <i>nothing</i> on him but a
<i>small</i> apron. The French do not seem to
have <i>any</i> idea what delicacy is.</p>


<h4>LAVOIR</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>June 29th.</i>&mdash;We went to the <i>lavoir</i> which
is at the end of the Avenue de Sceaux. It
is covered at both sides, and the water is
between. There are boxes full of straw
placed along for the women to kneel on.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>They beat the clothes with wooden things
of this shape <img src="images/p0124.png" width="22" height="25" alt="" />.
When we saw it this
time there were twenty women. One
good-natured, civil kind of woman took us
to see her wash-house, where she made lie.
She told us a great deal about the <i>lavoir</i>.
A porter takes charge of it; the <i>blanchisseuses</i>
pay three, and the <i>bourgeoises</i> four sous each
time, and so much for line for drying their
things upon. It closes at seven o'clock. The
people go to the porter and say, 'Place my
boxes in such a place for so many,' and then
he arranges them accordingly. I took a
sketch of the side of the <i>lavoir</i>; the people
seemed very much amused at it. One disagreeable
kind of woman called out, 'Mettez
moi en peinture, elle n'est pas gentille, je
suis plus gentille qu'elle,' and then she held
up her face to show us how pretty she was.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
She told us to draw a woman with a barrow,
and she laughed and said, 'Elle est blanchisseuse
de torchons.'</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>In France they do the things up <i>very</i> well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>but in the washing they spoil them very
much. They put the clothes into some kind
of liquid which brings the colour out, and
they beat them almost into holes. A gown
of the servants' was quite spoiled. Our
washerwoman had a little girl with green
bead baskets in her ears.</p>


<h3>July 1821</h3>

<h4>DUCHESSE D'ORLÉANS' FUNERAL&mdash;MARRIAGE</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 2nd.</i>&mdash;We went to the Avenue de
Paris to see the funeral of the Duchesse
d'Orléans, which was to come from Paris.
It was close weather; one heavy shower
came on and obliged us to take shelter under
the trees. There was a person sitting on a
stone who told us she was reduced, and
talked<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> a great deal. There were soldiers
along both sides of the avenue as far as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>eye could reach. There were a great many
cuirassiers; when the sun shone on their
steel armour it glittered very much; two of
their horses got loose and galloped all the
way down. We waited above two hours
before the funeral came. First there came
three men on horseback, and after them
several other men, then several shabby post-chaises,
and next the hearse, which was
covered with black velvet and silver. After
that came guards, pages, people, carriages,
etc. The avenue was <i>crowded</i> with people.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<div class="caption">CUIRASSIER</div>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>At twelve o'clock we went along with Miss
Ward and Miss Johnson<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> to Notre Dame to
see the marriage of Marshal Soult's nephew
to the <i>femme de chambre</i> of the Duchesse
d'Angoulême. We sat very near the altar.
The church was excessively full; there were
a great many English. The bride was not
at all pretty. She wore a white gauze gown
trimmed with flowers, over a white satin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>slip, and a veil fastened round her head with
a wreath of white roses. She was little, and
had not a good figure; the waist of her
gown was very long and made very high in
front (which most of the French gowns are),
which was not improving to her figure.
Marshal Soult was a vulgar-looking man,
with a cross, disagreeable countenance. His
nephew was not ill-looking. There were
three bridesmaids, who looked old enough
to be the bride's mother; they were little
and fat, and queerly dressed. The marriage
ceremony was chiefly done by the priest; he
read and prayed by himself, and seemed to
have nothing to do with them. At last they
each held a lighted candle; the priest read
some prayers to them; and one of the little
boys brought them a silver castle and a
silver plate to kiss. Marshal Soult seemed
to look at it with great contempt. During
one part of the ceremony a curtain was held
over them. While the ceremony was going
on we saw the priest do something that
appeared very irreverent. After he had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>praying on the steps of the altar, no sooner
had he risen than he spit on them: we afterwards
saw him dancing across the vestry.
After the ceremony there was a collection of
money. Miss Ward told us only to give a
sous or two; we observed the bridegroom
thought he had given too much, as he took
out of the plate what he had at first given,
and put in a smaller sum.</p>

<p>After we returned from the church there
was a great deal of rain, thunder and lightning.</p>


<h4>PALACE ROOMS&mdash;TRIANONS</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 3rd.</i>&mdash;A very hot day. We went
along with uncle Lancaster to see the inside
of the palace. The first part we were shown
into was the chapel. It is extremely beautiful
and magnificent. We looked at it over
the railing, which is marble and gold; the
ceiling is painted, and the organ (though
silver) is very light and pretty. We next
entered the Salon d'Hercule. It is 64 feet
long and 54 broad. It is entirely composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>of beautiful marble; there is a great deal of
painting and gold about the ceiling. The
Salle de l'Attendance, Salle de Vénus, Salle
de Diane, Salle de Mars, Salle de Mercure,
etc., are all much alike, decorated with painting,
gold, and marble. After passing through
these splendid apartments several other large
rooms appeared quite small. The King's
library is not fine, nor the bedrooms of the
King and Queen. There are some very
curious glass closets in which one sees oneself
reflected at the top, the bottom, and all
sides, apparently without end. The &#338;il de
B&#339;uf is a long room, but not very splendid.
In it is a picture of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> surrounded
by his family; at the end is a round window
like an ox's eye. There is a very plain
dining-room, white, with small paintings,
which, though <i>nothing</i> like the other rooms,
I liked very much; it was quite a relief to
my eyes after so much splendour. The
Salle de la Guerre is a good deal painted
and gilt; there are some very good imitations
of bronze. From this you enter the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>Grande Galerie, which is 222 feet long, 32
broad, and 40 high. There are seventeen
large windows, and as many mirrors opposite
to them. These are separated by pillars of
marble. On the ceiling is painted, in nine
large pictures and eighteen small ones, the
history of Louis <span class="smcap">xiv</span>. From the windows of
this gallery you have a good view of the
gardens. When we were there they were
repairing part of it. We passed from this to
the Salon de la Paix and several other apartments.
The Salle de l'Opéra is very large,
and I dare say when it is lighted up it
would look very fine; but I thought it far
the least pretty of any of the rooms; it
looked gone to ruin. The staircase in the
palace is marble. The only piece of furniture
in the whole palace is a small clock.
I don't think I ever saw anything so unlike
the residence of a king: there appears to be
nothing but gold, marble, glass, and paintings.
A man shows the rooms, to whom
you give something; both times I was there
it was full of people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>We went through the gardens to the Grand
Trianon. The rooms are all on one floor.
They look very different to the rooms of the
other palace, but amusing in their way. We
waited in a hall for the person to conduct us
through the other apartments. In one of the
rooms there is a beautiful inlaid table, round
which are represented the signs of the zodiac;
it was made by a pupil of Sicard who was
deaf and dumb. The beds have plumes of
white feathers at the top; they reminded us
of hearses. Some of the chairs are very pretty
tapestry worked in lilies, roses, and birds.
There are also several tapestry pictures.
There is a long gallery between the windows,
in which there are a great many models of
ships. There are also several statues and
some curious little agate ornaments in it.
In one room there is a beautiful green malachite-of-copper
basin, and slabs of the same,
given by the Emperor of Russia to Maria
Louisa; the man who showed us the rooms
did not seem to like to speak about it. In
the same room there were some common,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>vulgar tongs, such as one would not see in a
kitchen. There were gold arrows on the
chimney-piece for lights, and very pretty
lustres. I think the palace is a great deal
more <i>amusing</i> than the other. After we had
been through the rooms we got some cider
and cakes at the place where we left our
umbrellas. We did not see the gardens,
which are said to be pretty.</p>

<p>When we were rested we went to the
Petit Trianon. There is nothing at all to
see in the rooms; it is like any small private
house. The Queen's bed is gold muslin, and
the walls of the room are covered with blue
silk. The gardens are remarkably pretty;
they are made in imitation of English gardens,
designed by the unfortunate Marie
Antoinette, and have none of the stiffness
and formality of the other French gardens.
At one part of the garden there is the figure
of a Chinese holding an umbrella; it ought
all to turn round like a swing. Near that is
a small theatre, or rather music-room. There
are little streams in different parts of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>gardens, an artificial river, and a pond.
After you cross a bridge with rocks at the
sides, you enter a dark grotto, from which
you go out by a staircase. There is a music-room
and a temple and a tower; the man
<i>told</i> us that the late Queen used to get on the
top of the tower and sing. The pond scenery
makes quite a pretty landscape; several
willows overhang it, and three or four swans
were swimming in it; at one side there is
a farm-house, a dairy, and a mill. We were
told that the Queen used sometimes to dress
herself up like an English farmer's wife, and
call herself Mrs. Browne; she used to stay
at the farm, and her attendants used to dress
up as her servants.</p>

<p>We returned home very much tired with
the heat; in the evening there was rain,
thunder and lightning.</p>


<h4>MADAME VERNIER</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 6th.</i>&mdash;As our house was very cold,
and the stone floors were thought to be bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>for Catherine, we took a house in the Rue
Reservoir, which we this day went to; before
we went, however, we had quite a battle with
Madame Vernier. We warned her a fortnight
before that we were going to quit the
house; but it was at five in the afternoon,
and she said we ought to have given her
warning before twelve; she therefore charged
us for another month. As mamma knew
this was an imposition she was determined
not to pay it. She sent for the proprietor of
the house (who was very civil), and also for
Madame Vernier. The proprietor talked to
her a long time, but she would take no less;
he then wanted Miss Wragge to go with her
to the <i>juge de paix</i>, which of course she did
not do. Madame Vernier had been a camp-follower:
she was a great, fat woman with
a voice like a man's. We heard of several
tricks that she had played the English; she
said that the French had payed plenty of
contributions, and she was determined that
the English should make up for it. Once
when some people would not pay her what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>she asked for, she went round the house and
picked out every scratch and hole, saying
a franc for this, and so much for that, till she
made up the sum she wanted. Another
time she charged an unreasonable price to
some people who were dining there (her
husband was a <i>restaurateur</i>), and on their
refusing to pay it she locked the gates and
threatened to detain their trunks. As the
gentleman was very lame, he was glad to
pay what she required and get off, though
they had bargained before for dinner at so
much less per head! When mamma knew
what a woman she was she determined not
to pay her for the next month. Accordingly
she sent for papa, who was at Paris, and
papa and Dr. Murdoch (who had resided
long in France and spoke French perfectly)
went along with Madame Vernier to the <i>juge
de paix</i>, who said she was wrong, and in
case of her detaining our trunks gave papa
the name of a <i>huissier</i>. Madame Vernier
told the <i>juge de paix</i> that papa had attempted
to strangle her, to which he replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>that she looked more likely to strangle one
of the <i>garde de corps</i>. She told him that
he knew nothing at all about it, and came
away in a great passion. She then got a
relation of hers who was a lawyer's clerk (or
something of the kind), and she brought
him upstairs to convince us. The proprietor
tried to persuade her to take the money; she,
however, refused it; but when she found
papa was determined not to give any more
they all went downstairs, and after consulting
a little while, she sent up to say she would
take the money. After this contest she was,
like a tamed lion, and was quite civil. We
went to our house in the Rue Reservoir,
which we did not find quite so comfortable
as we had expected.</p>

<h4>NEW HOUSE</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 7th.</i>&mdash;Our new house was nearly
opposite the theatre, which on a Sunday,
particularly, was crowded with people; every
Sunday evening a number of drunken people
passed our windows; one Sunday we counted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>six close together.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Our servants went one
day to the play, but it was so dirty that it
made them quite sick. Near our house was
a priests' school; we used to hear the boys
singing a great part of the day and sometimes
in the night. Behind our house there
was a small garden with very little in it.
When mamma went to see the house two of
the rooms were carpeted, and everything was
very comfortable. Although Monsieur Grincourt
had several days to prepare it, when
we came to our new house the carpets were
taken up, the curtains were taken off some
of the beds, and everything was uncomfortable.
The fireplaces were full of every kind
of rubbish. There were not enough plates,
glasses, etc. And we were reduced to many
curious expedients. The French are very
dilatory about bringing things. We saw
they did not intend to give us back our
carpets, as the next day they sent a frotteur<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>to clean the floors; however, as we had taken
the house with a carpet, we told them to
bring it, and we used to send Nannette to
scold every day till at last we got all we
wanted. They also brought quilts for the
beds, but they gave great charges that they
were to be taken off at night. We got two
tea-kettles which were a most extraordinary
shape. The French make some little things
very nicely, and other common things extremely
awkwardly. There was a bath in
the house, and the room adjoining it was
remarkably damp; a great many toad-stools
grew in the closet; there was also an ants'
nest below the floor. The porter's wife was
<i>much</i> younger than the one in our other
house; her husband lived at Paris; she had
one son of eleven or twelve, a very rude boy.
Different people lived above us, latterly a
Mr. and Mrs. Spurrier. Mr. Spurrier was
determined his French servants should do
like English servants; if he succeeded, I
think he did more than any person did
before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<h4>SUNDAY</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 8th.</i>&mdash;The lady above stairs played
the whole day without ceasing on the harp;
the boys at the priests' school made more
noise than usual in their playground; numbers
of people were going to a village fête; a
great many people passed by on their way to
the theatre, among whom was Mademoiselle
Croissé; we counted six drunken people;
shops were open as usual, and people going
about their work as on any other day. On
Sunday Madame Crosnier's girls spent the
day in working and dancing.</p>


<h4>VILLAGE FÊTE</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 9th.</i>&mdash;We went in a carriage to see
the village fête of Louvécienne. Little Miss
Foaker went with us. It was a fine evening.
Louvécienne, or Lucien, is above four miles
from Versailles; it is very pretty about the
village. There were lamps hung across the
trees, and seats placed round on the ground
where they danced. Three fiddlers were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>stuck up in a kind of orchestra, and they
played a very dull tune extremely badly. I
was very much disappointed in the dancing:
it was more like a funeral than a dance. The
figure was a quadrille. They walked it all
till they came to the setting, which they
danced in their way, which was almost duller
than the walking. All the time they were
dancing their faces were as grave as judges:
they behaved as if it was a lesson they wished
to be done with; as soon as the dance was
done they laughed, pulled each other round,
and ran off to buy a sweetmeat at one of the
booths; then they came back as grave as
possible. One of the nicest girls was dressed
in a white gown, pink apron, green shoes,
and a gold chain; there was one very impudent,
disagreeable, vulgar woman, dressed
in blue cotton. Some were in white, and
some had on red petticoats, high caps, gold
chains, etc. There were booths, stalls, whirligigs,
roundabouts, etc., like an English fair.
We saw an old man and woman of sixty or
seventy riding in a roundabout. At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>other end, near some trees, there was a party
of ladies and gentlemen; they danced much
like the peasants, in some respects worse&mdash;one
or two of them, however, danced tolerably
well. This party had rather better music,
but very dull. As we went away they were
beginning to light the lamps. It looked very
pretty to see the people under the trees, but
the dancing nearly put one to sleep, and the
music was like a funeral dirge. They say
that the French like dancing better than anything,
and we heard it very much admired.
For my part, I think it is neither graceful,
nor pretty, nor merry.</p>

<h4>MUSEUM</h4>

<p><i>Tuesday, July 10th.</i>&mdash;We went up to Paris
at nine o'clock to see the museum; it was a
fine morning, but rather cold. It is a very
pretty drive; the country is beautiful about
the Seine. There were a great many bluebottles
and scarlet poppies in the corn, more
than I ever saw in England; the fields looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>like a sheet of blue and red. In Paris they
sell pretty wreaths of bluebottles. We met
a cart guarded by eight soldiers, with nothing
in it but old chairs and broken tables.
We arrived at Paris at twelve o'clock, and
went to two flower-shops, where were beautiful
artificial flowers. The carnations were
scented. They had not many wreaths: the
flowers that brides wear are the buds of
orange flowers. We bought several single
flowers, jessamine, roses, camilla,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> japonica,
etc. From this we all went to the cabinet
d'Histoire Naturelle. We remarked the floating
baths on the Seine. When we reached
the Jardin des Plantes the museum was not
open, so we walked in the garden till three
o'clock, when the doors are opened. There
was quite a crowd of people of all ranks. I
think it is wonderful that the things are not
hurt, as the people press close to the glasses.
We went to the upper gallery first, that we
might have more time to examine it. Several
rooms open one into the other. There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>soldiers with swords in their hands, walking
up and down. We had not time to look at
everything; we only skimmed over the things.
The first rooms contain above two hundred
monkeys; we scarcely looked at them at all.
In this museum there seems to be every
kind of creature. There is a great quantity
of bats of all sizes; a rat with a young one
on its back; some very small mice, marmottes,
opossums, armadillos, lions, tigers,
panthers, etc.; a horse; most beautiful little
deer, some very small; a chevrotin; cats and
dogs. These were all in <i>glass cases</i> round
the room. In the middle of the room there
were two enormous elephants, a rhinoceros,
etc., a hippopotamus, which is a frightful-looking
creature with an immense mouth.
On the top of the cases there is a morse. In
the middle of the next room there is a whale,
a wild ox, a buffalo, and a cameleopard which
almost touched the top of the room. There
was the skin of a snake, like a trunk of a
tree, near the top of the room. The animals
in the middle of the room were not in cases.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>There was a great variety of springboks,
sjrisboks, etc., in this room, and also porcupines,
foxes, and a variety of other animals.</p>

<p>The most beautiful and amusing room was
that in which the birds were. There were a
great many owls; pink spoonbills, scarlet
flamingoes, toucans, parrots of every colour,
very pretty kingfishers, penguins, cassowarys,
peacocks and hens; there was one
petrified ibis. The most beautiful were the
humming-birds; their colours were quite
dazzling: some were very small, and others
larger. There was one beautiful forked-tailed
humming-bird: its throat was of the
most brilliant green, and its breast amethyst
purple; the rest of its body was a shining
black. The topaz humming-bird is also very
pretty; it has a yellow breast and a red
topping. The red-throated humming-bird is
also pretty, but not so brilliant as my favourite
fork-tail. One of the larger humming-birds
is all bright black, like velvet, except the
neck, which is the colour of an emerald. No
colours could express the brightness of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>plumage. There were several nests which
were whitish. In the same case with the
humming-birds there were some scarlet
creepers, very bright and pretty, and one or
two blue creepers which were like precious
stones. We examined this case longer than
any other.</p>

<p>There was a glass case up the middle of
the room in which were lobsters, corals,
shells, sponges, etc. In one part all the
insects were arranged. The butterflies were
the most beautiful things I ever saw. There
was one very large blue one that dazzled my
eyes to look at; another black and bluish
lilac; and the Amboyna butterfly, an immense
green and black one, with most brilliant
colours and shining like velvet. There were
several small ones striped yellow and black;
one very beautiful small scarlet and purple
one; several very large greyish butterflies or
moths which had small clear spots in their
wings like glass; there were two or three
smallish butterflies marked with every colour
like marble. The large butterflies were excessively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>beautiful. There were several
English ones beside them that looked quite
dull and ugly. There were a great many
large moths; one grey and a great deal
marked was even bigger than the green
butterfly; there was another beautiful large
grey moth with purple eyes in its under
wings. Besides the butterflies there were
several other insects: dragon-flies, the colours
of which were quite gone; enormous spiders;
a great variety of bees; an ant lion at the
bottom of a small pit; very large caterpillars;
and a great many other insects.</p>

<p>We then went to the lower gallery, which
is not so amusing; but there are some
curious fishes, a crocodile, very pretty marbles,
a large piece of gold ore, and a great
variety of stones, etc. Instead of real
precious stones there were only imitations
in glass, which looked very shabby. I was
very sorry to leave the museum; it was the
most amusing and beautiful thing in France.
It closes at five o'clock. After we had left it
we returned to Versailles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<h4>DUCHESSE DE BERRI&mdash;DUCHESSE
D'ANGOULÊME</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 15th.</i>&mdash;Hearing a great deal of noise
amongst the boys in the priests' school, we
enquired what was the matter, and were told
that it was the Duchesse d'Angoulême and
the Duchesse de Berri come to visit the
priests' school. We went out to see them,
and after waiting a very long time for them,
they at last came out, got into an open
carriage, and drove away very quickly.
There were a lady and a gentleman in the
carriage with them, and several soldiers on
horseback. There were a great many priests
and boys looking out of the windows.
Neither the Duchesse d'Angoulême nor
the Duchesse de Berri are pretty: the
Duchesse de Berri has very red eyes.
Before this we had heard of the death
of Buonaparte. A man used to go about
the streets with a bundle of papers, crying,
'Voici les dernières paroles, et la confession
importante que faisoit Napoléon Buonaparte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>avant de mourir.' We were told that this
was a famous spy. It was hot weather for
two or three days, and every person watered
before their doors.</p>


<h4>ENGLISH ROBBERS</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 17th.</i>&mdash;This evening we had just
returned from walking in the gardens when
we were told by the servants that three
English robbers had been just then taken
up. There were two men and a woman,
who had robbed some English at an hotel
in Paris of a great deal of money, and gone
off with it; they were, however, all stopped
and taken up at Versailles. We heard of
another Englishman that had swindled. An
English lady told us that at Boulogne there
were quantities of English who came over in
debt, and that a prison there was so full of
English that it was called the British Hotel.</p>


<h4>HAYFIELD&mdash;MUSIC&mdash;CHILD</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 18th.</i>&mdash;This (and several other)
evenings we walked to the hayfield near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>the Trianons. There were a great many
grasshoppers and brown butterflies (meadow
arguses) flying out of the haycocks. We
sat down on the hay, and Miss Wragge got
a wisp of hay round her leg, which she took
for a snake; this amused the people very
much. Near here we used to see some little
pensions of poor children going out to walk.
At the gate of the Trianons we saw a little
child of about three years old standing. It
came up to us with a straw in its hand,
which it held like a soldier; it then put it
to our faces and tickled them. We asked
it where it lived; it said 'là-bas.' Miss
Wragge gave it a sou. The French children
have a very forward manner; they come up
to strangers and talk quite at their ease.
We returned by the gardens. There was
now a band of music (every Wednesday and
Friday) in the King's garden, or the Tapis-vert.
There were a great many flowers out
in the King's garden: many different sorts
of columbine, honeysuckle, syringas, and
roses on sticks. The trees in the garden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>(Hartwell) are not cut like those in the rest
of the garden, but are suffered to grow naturally.
The music was not pretty; the players
seemed very much afraid of tiring themselves,
as they rested more than half the
time. While the music played to-day, the
Tapis-vert was crowded with people. We
observed one little boy, who did not look
more than three or four years old, with light
curly hair and rosy cheeks; he had a kind of
little bag before him, in which were different
sweetmeats&mdash;dogs, lambs, etc. He ran to
every person and begged them to buy; his
little sweetmeats were a sou apiece. At
first we thought it looked very pretty to see
the little fellow selling the things, but we
soon discovered that he was accompanied by
a very disagreeable woman, and as the child
followed and plagued every one it was
quite unpleasant. As we returned through
the gardens we saw some watering-pots&mdash;great,
awkward, copper things&mdash;which we
drew on our nails. This was a fine day.</p>

<h4>MONSIEUR SOUPÉ</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 20th.</i>&mdash;Monsieur Soupé (from whom
we got our wine) was the King's wine-merchant.
He told us that there were 500
bottles of wine a day drunk in the King's
house, and that the bills are settled every
night; and that the King breakfasts at
twelve o'clock on eggs and tea. He told
us also that he had seen Buonaparte dine,
and that he never took longer than eleven
minutes. In the beginning of Louis <span class="smcap">xvi</span>.'s
reign 1300 bottles a day were drunk.</p>


<h4>SHEPHERD</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 21st.</i>&mdash;This evening (being fine) we
walked past the Trianons. We met a shepherd
with a flock of Andalusian sheep, and
two fine dogs with pieces of wood hung to
their necks. He had a crook in his hand,
and a bag with a bottle in it by his side;
one end of his crook was brass, and at the
other there was a kind of little spade. We
stopped to talk with the shepherd. Papa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>asked him what the dogs' names were; he
answered 'Petit et Beau-Rouge.' The wood
was round their necks so that he might know
them. He said that he used the crook to
catch the sheep by their legs. He told us
that the use of the spade was to punish his
dogs, and to explain what he meant, he dug
up a piece of earth and threw it at them.
Papa asked what was in his bottle. 'Méchant
cidre,' he answered. Papa gave him a franc
to fill the bottle.</p>


<h4>BAL CHAMPÊTRE</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 26th.</i>&mdash;We drove out in the carriage
this afternoon with Catherine, who was
getting better, and who frequently drove
out. We went round by the Trianons; in
the forest we saw some pretty roebucks,
which bounded through the wood. We
passed a field full of lilac poppies. In returning
we stopped at the Boulevard de
St. Antoine, where there was a <i>bal champêtre</i>.
There were lamps hung on the trees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>The music was very dull. We saw them
dance two quadrilles. One <i>garde du corps</i>
danced in a most extraordinary manner: he
jumped and hopped, and kicked and bounced,
as if he had learned off a bear at the North
Pole. His partner, a little girl of ten or
eleven years old, danced very well. One
lady in a pink silk bonnet seemed as if she
had learned in the French style, but wanted
to dance lighter, for she walked two or three
steps and then jumped up. They all kept
bad time, walked and hopped. The three
Miss Williams and their father were there.
In the middle of their dance a heavy shower
of rain came on; everybody ran into a house
or went home. We saw the Miss Williams
standing under a tree, like three white graces,
half-way home.</p>


<h4>TOADSTOOLS, ETC.</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 28th.</i>&mdash;This was an excessively rainy
day; we found ten toadstools in Catherine's
room. There were several people dining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>here; there were fires in the rooms, which
everybody was glad to get near. It was wet,
disagreeable weather. We were all waiting
eagerly to go home; the days seemed like
weeks. To make them appear shorter, I
made a list of all the days till the time we
were to go home, and I scratched out one
each day. This day was Nannette's fête;
she went to a Dutch frow (a German woman),
who gave her a nosegay.</p>


<h4>BELLE VUE</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 29th.</i>&mdash;We drove out this evening to
Belle Vue. It was a fine evening. We saw
a man standing before his door watering
some boxes full of mushrooms. At Belle
Vue we went through a house where we had
a very fine view of Paris, the Seine and St.
Cloud. We looked at a vineyard; there
were no grapes on the vines there. We
heard that the bad season had injured
them.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<h4>PRIESTS WITH HOST&mdash;CORPSE, ETC.</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>July 30th.</i>&mdash;As we were walking out, we
saw some priests carrying the host to a
sick person across the street. A boy in
red and white walked first, carrying a lantern
on the top of a stick; next went
another boy carrying a cross. After him
two men in scarlet holding a little red
canopy over the priest who carried the host.
The sick man died next day. The servants
saw the body laid out in the <i>porte cochère</i>
with a vessel of holy water and a ladle
beside it; every person that went past took
a ladle full of holy water and sprinkled
the corpse with it.</p>

<h3>August 1821</h3>

<h4>VILLE D'AVRY</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>August 4th.</i>&mdash;We drove out this evening
to Ville d'Avry. This drive is the prettiest
I saw about Versailles; there are woody
banks and paths, more like England. It
was late when we reached the village, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>there was a clear, bright moon; and a woody
hill with a house on the top, looked exceedingly
pretty in the moonlight. There was
also a house under a woody bank covered
with vines; and a man was standing on a
ladder pruning them. This place is beautiful;
more like what I had imagined France. We
got out of the carriage to see it plainer.</p>


<h4>KING AND WATERS</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>August 6th.</i>&mdash;We were told this morning
that the King and Prince Leopold were
expected at Versailles. Quantities of troops
passed our windows in their way to the
Avenue Trianon, where the King was to
review them. There were some La Roche
Jacquellines on black horses. At about
twelve o'clock we went (along with Mr. and
Mrs. Spurrier) to Neptune's Bath, near which
the King was to pass. The women charged
a franc apiece for our chairs. There were
rows of soldiers behind the trees. There
was a great quantity of people around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>Neptune's Bath; there seemed to be nearly
all Versailles.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>There were several carriages waiting for
the King in case it should rain, etc.; one of
them was gold and red, very gaudy-looking.
A carriage came on first before the King.
When the King came, one needed four eyes:
to look at the King on one side and round
to Neptune's Bath at the other, for as soon
as ever he came the waters began to play like
fairy-work. The water shot out of each vase,
Neptune's horses spouted, and the whole
water seemed covered with spouts and cascades.
In the first open carriage was the
King, the Duchess d'Angoulême, Monsieur,
and the Duchess de Berri. Prince Leopold
did not come. Several carriages followed
with attendants. The King is a <i>very</i> fat, contented-looking
man. As soon as the carriages
had passed the waters stopped. It was an
extremely pretty sight. The King went on
to the Trianons and stayed there for a long
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>while. When he returned the waters played
again. They came back with large bunches
of flowers in each carriage. We saw great
numbers of the soldiers returning. Although
the waters played for so short a time, some
of the pipes burst. It costs 1200 francs
every time the great waters play. The
<i>restaurateurs</i> make a great deal of money
when they play, as it brings numbers of
people from Paris. About a week before
this the <i>restaurateurs</i> caused it to be put in
the newspapers that the great waters were to
play; and this brought a great many people,
who found to their disappointment that it
was all false.</p>

<h4>SÈVRE</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>August 7th.</i>&mdash;A very honest man with a
<i>voiture</i> was to come for us from Abbeville,
and then we were to go home. We expected
him on Thursday, but to our great joy he
came to-day, two days sooner than was
expected. The whole house was in confusion;
I was so delighted that I hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>knew what to do. We set off directly to see
the china manufactory at Sèvre. The day
was very fine, and we had a most pleasant
ride. The rooms in which the china was
were up a long pair of stairs. In the first
room there was nothing but plain white
china: the plates are a franc apiece. There
were beautiful large painted vases, some with
landscapes on them, some purple, and others
brown. Very pretty white baskets of flowers;
three little children under lace veils made of
white biscuit china. Curious-shaped salt-cellars;
an inkstand the shape of a boat, etc.;
several pictures, one of the King, the Duchesse
d'Angoulême, Sappho, etc.; beautiful cups
with humming-birds painted on them; a set
of plates with flowers, jonquils, polyanthuses,
etc., on them; another set with roses, and
another with vegetables, with their names
marked in gold; Bacchus and Ceres in a
car drawn by bulls ornamented with wreaths
of gold flowers&mdash;the figures are white; a
set of plates with Eastern pictures on them,
and another with birds beautifully painted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>There are several very large vases: one with
a purple ground that cost 27,000 francs.
There is a large china table on which Minerva
is represented presenting the Louvre
and other galleries to France. Another
table, on which there are different palaces,
cost 35,000 francs. There were also some
very pretty white ornaments, with cones on
the top and baskets of grapes about them.
On one plate there is a view of Windsor,
and on another General &mdash;&mdash; drowning in
a river in Egypt.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p>The man told us that china was much
cheaper than formerly. There was a transparency
in the window; and some round
pieces of glass on which were feathers,
flowers, sea-weeds, etc., made in the shape of
birds. From Sèvres we drove to St. Cloud.
We could not go in front of the palace because
the King was there. I did not think
it pretty; there were a number of stalls
and shops near it which did not look well.
There were a great many guards. We returned
home by Ville Daure, a very pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>drive. As soon as we got home the whole
house was in a bustle, as we were to set off
next morning. We had shoes to buy, calls
to make, bills to pay, clothes to get from the
washerwoman's, masters to pay, gowns to
get from Mademoiselle Bouillet, and things
to pack up. In the midst of all this bustle,
Nannette, who had gone up to Paris, had
not returned when she promised, so we left
Versailles without her knowing it. We
tasted some green almonds at dessert, which
were tasteless and insipid. The servants
packed till two o'clock in the morning; they
got the clothes from the wash at twelve at
night. All was confusion, but every person
was merry. It was the happiest day we
spent in France. I went to bed with delight,
happy to think it was the last night I should
sleep at Versailles.</p>


<h4>WEDNESDAY</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>August 8th, 1821.</i>&mdash;We had a cool but
pleasant day to begin our journey. Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>Wragge did not get her gown from Mademoiselle
Bouillet till we were all in the
carriage, and she declared she would not go
without it, and told the man to drive off.
At last after <i>great</i> bustling we set off at
eleven o'clock; papa, mamma, Catherine and
Caroline went before in the carriage, the
rest of us went in the <i>voiture</i>. I never felt
so little regret at leaving a place. I looked
with joy at the houses and people, glad to
think I should see them no more. We sang
most part of the way. At a distance we saw
the convent of St. Cyr. We passed the very
long, fine aqueduct of Marli, and a small
one further on. About here it was pretty
country; there were a good many vineyards
and orchards in corn. We had a view of
Mount Calvary; near which we saw a set of
gypsies by the side of the road. We then
saw the Seine running through a pretty
valley; and numerous vineyards continued
to St. Germains, about which the country
is pretty and well wooded. We stopped for
some time at Poissy while the man rested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>his horses. The house was like a public-house,
but the mistress was a civil little
woman. There was a cloth on the table on
which was some Gruyère cheese, a loaf of
bread and some pears; we took the pears,
which were very good: she charged a franc.
She told us that an English lady had
been staying there a month. There was a
pretty view out of the window. We walked
along beside the river, and got a nice view
from the bridge; there were a number of
washer-women beating their clothes, and
the water was white with soap-suds. After
we had left Poissy we saw several horses
carrying corn; their backs being hung with
sheaves in a very curious manner. The
corn about here did not look good. There
was a good deal of asparagus; in some
places there were alternate rows of corn and
asparagus. The man who drove us sang
most of the time, and altered his voice: he
had been in England, and he said that when
he came back to France he could not persuade
the people that in England it took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>only one man to shoe a horse. He had an
English dog with him, which he said understood
English, French, and Spanish. The
name of the man was Jean de Grange. Here
the country was not so pretty, as there are no
hedges; the patches of corn and grass looked
just like ribbons, particularly on the side of
a hill. We reached Mantes in the evening.
After crossing two bridges we saw a curious
old church. The river looked full of soap;
I think the water must be very unwholesome
considering the quantity of soap which goes
into it. We went to Hôtel du Grand Cerf.
The floor of the parlour was boarded, and
there were two vases full of artificial flowers;
the people of the inn were civil. Two of
our beds were in the parlour, from which
they were divided by doors that shut like
a closet.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>August 9th.</i>&mdash;We set off at a quarter to
six. There were a few vineyards, but the
country was not pretty as far as Châlons.
The banks of the Seine are quite lovely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>and the river looks well here, as there are
several islands in it. We saw a boat full
of cattle going across the river. There are
a good many houses and vineyards on the
banks. Further on there were rows of walnut
and plum trees by the roadside, which
looked very pretty. The corn looked fine,
but very much laid. There were not any
animals, except here and there a skinny cow
tethered by the roadside. We breakfasted
at Vernon. The room we were in was very
shabby. In one corner of a room we passed
through there was a queer jug&mdash;a boy sitting
across a barrel. They brought us in an odd-looking
teapot; the water was smoked, as the
tea-kettle had no lid, and the tea tasted like
herbs and water; the milk too was thymy,
the butter bad, and the bread sour. We had
been told that in this part of the country
chickens were <i>fourpence</i> a pair; the woman
here told us that they were <i>three francs</i> and
a half. It was at Vernon we saw a man
sitting at the door eating a raw artichoke
and oil. After leaving Vernon there came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>on a heavy shower of rain. We saw several
men mowing the corn. When it was fair,
we got out at a cottage to gather some plums;
the man shook the tree, and we picked up
those that fell; we gave him half a franc,
with which he seemed satisfied. We walked
up a hill where we saw several butterflies;
some with black and yellow striped upper
wings, and under wings the colour of a dead
leaf. There were rows of apple and pear
trees; we picked up a few apples and pears
which were not ripe; the apples were like
alum and the pears like stone. The country
was here much prettier: it was more like
England; we even saw a few flocks of sheep,
but they did not seem to get much: in one
place they were eating the earth. As we
were walking up the hill an old woman came
to beg; the driver offered her a card of an
inn, which he told her was a Bank of
England note: she did not, however, take
it, but turned away. There were several
crucifixes in the villages and at the side
of the road. The women about here had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>generally short petticoats, and <i>very</i> high
caps. The babies were wrapped up in
swaddling-clothes, like mummies. We stopt
at Louviers. The inn was very poor and
shabby. The mistress had on a curious cap
with long muslin lappets. While dinner was
preparing we walked through the town. We
went into a curious old cathedral, where were
several figures with candles burning before
them, and some Virgins dressed with little
veils, artificial flowers, etc. There were a
great many people kneeling down and repeating
prayers. We went into a shop to look for
some caps, but they asked a great deal for the
commonest, so we did not buy them. The
women here all wore the high caps. There
was one little boy with long flaxen hair, and
the lady who was with him took off his velvet
cap to shew us his hair. On our way home
we saw the same man and boys dancing upon
stilts that I had seen at Paris: there was a
great crowd round them, and a woman went
about collecting money, saying, 'Encouragez
la petite famille.' When we reached the inn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>dinner had been ready some time. As soon
as we had dined we continued our journey.
We passed Pont Large in going out of the
town. The country was beautiful, and we had
another view of the Seine; they were making
hay on one of the islands. Our eyes were
quite refreshed by seeing two or three green
fields <i>hedged</i> in, with a few cows feeding
in them. Certainly if any person wished
to have a pleasant impression of France they
ought to come this way: it is beyond comparison
prettier than the Calais road; the banks
of the Seine are so beautiful. Near Rouen
there is a chalk rock and several caverns with
people living in them; and we had another
beautiful view of the river. It was dark
when we reached Rouen. It is an old, ugly
town, but there appeared to be some good
shops. We stopped at the Custom-house
(there were a number of ships near it): they
did not examine our trunks, but sent a person
on to the inn with us. We went to the Hôtel
de Normandie, which was all in confusion;
the father of the people there was <i>just</i> dead:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>their mother had been dead two years. When
papa and mamma asked what we could have
for dinner, they said anything; after it was
ordered, however, they brought in only very
few of the things and said the table d'hôte
had eaten it all: and then they brought in
two raw pigeons and asked if we would
like to have them dressed. One of the hotel
servants had been at Brighton, and she said
she was very sorry to leave England, and
was going to try to get there again. She
spoke English tolerably.</p>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="p2"><i>August 10th.</i>&mdash;Before breakfast we went
to see the Church of St. Ouen, where there
is a beautiful wheel-window over the organ.
One of the churches here is like a coach-house.
We set off again at nine. The
streets we passed through were extremely
narrow and dirty, and the town looked very
busy, particularly about the shipping and
river.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> We had a fine view of a hill just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>out of the town. There were a few hedges
here. We saw a coffin covered with black
and white velvet on some chairs before a
door, with several candles burning round it,
and a procession of priests and boys with
crucifixes at a distance. As we were walking
up a hill we saw an old beggar
woman sitting by the roadside in a bower
of dead leaves: her petticoat was covered
with patches of all colours; she begged
of us as we went past. We also saw two
very curious figures with gilt caps and red
cloaks. We did not see <i>near</i> so many
beggars this way as we did on the Calais
road. We stopped at Tôtes, where we dined.
Before dinner we walked out past a long
building; we asked some women what it
was: they told us it was a corn-market,
which belonged to Madame D'Ossonval <i>seigneur
du village</i>. We got sugared peas, etc.,
for dinner. After Tôtes, the country was
pretty: there were hedges like England.
A good many of the people here (especially
the old women) wore ugly cotton caps and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>ribbons and crosses. We walked up a hill
near Dieppe. I almost strained my eyes to
see the sea; it was what I had wished to see
for a long time; at last, when we had reached
the top of a hill, we had a view of the sea
and of Dieppe. We went to Taylor's English
hotel. Out of the window of the sitting-room
you look upon the ships: it is close to
the harbour. This day we saw none of the
curious caps we had heard about.</p>

<div class="caption">OLD WOMAN WITH A COTTON CAP</div>
</div>

<hr class="r5" />

<p class="p2"><i>August 11th.</i>&mdash;After breakfast we went
into the market, where we saw quite as
curious figures as we had expected. Some
of the caps had lappets like butterflies' wings,
and large bunches of hair turned up behind.
We saw some of the hair hanging at a shop-door:
it was coarse like horse-hair. A
number of the people were dressed in black.
We saw three women, like a mother and her
daughters, coming in to market with baskets
on their arms. They had on black gowns,
aprons, and handkerchiefs; caps, the lappets
of which blew out with the wind and showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>a great bunch of hair; and gold ornaments
about their necks. There was one woman
selling fruit who had on a very curious cap:
the frame was made of pasteboard, and the
front of it covered with gold, silver, spangles,
tinsel, etc.; round the top there was a long
piece of muslin which hung almost to the
ground. The women we saw in the market
had their lappets pinned up. Some of the
old women had on cotton caps. We passed
several shops (in our way to the market) full
of little ivory ships and figures beautifully
cut. We walked up to the castle, from which
we saw the whole of the town. We afterwards
went on the cliffs on the outside of
the castle, from which we had a view of the
sea with several boats on it. A woman came
and spoke to us about a house which she
had to let; she spoke very bad French: she
called <i>cinquante</i> '<i>shinquante</i>.' I could hardly
understand the Dieppe people; they spoke so
much through their noses.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> We wanted to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>buy a cap and a pair of sabots. We went
into two or three shops before we could get
a cap to our mind; we at last got a leno cap
and an under cap to wear with it, such as the
women in black wore, which was the most
common kind. They told us that a gilt cap
when new cost 20 francs. Our sabots cost
sixpence: the old woman thought we intended
to wear them, and said we ought to
have a nicer kind. We asked several people
the way to the Church of St. Remi: the
people of Dieppe seemed to have a disagreeable
manner. The Church of St. Remi
is not beautiful. In one of the little chapels
there was a small figure of the Virgin Mary
with a child in her arms; her petticoats
were painted scarlet, and she had on a lace
veil, a crown, and a bunch of flowers in her
hand. We went to see the Church of St.
Jacques. There is a very pretty purple wheel-window
over the organ; and in a kind of recess
in the wall there were a great many figures
holding a sheet covered with real flowers:
before which there were twenty-nine candles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>burning; several people came and stuck in a
candle. We looked into several of the little
chapels: in one there was a virgin, in another
a ship, in another some filigree work in frames.
We dined at the table d'hôte. There were five
English gentlemen. We could not sail this
evening, as the wind blew into the harbour;
so we went to buy pears to take in the ship
next day. While we were buying the pears
we observed a number of children standing
about and looking at the fruit. Papa bought
some currants and held them out to the
children, upon which they all ran away; papa
and the woman told them that the currants
were for them, but they cried and seemed
quite stupid. At last one boy rather bigger
than the rest took courage and said to the
others, 'Comme vous êtes bêtes'; and they
all began to eat, except one little child who
screamed and tried to get away, and a little
girl who ran home. We were all anxious to
go next day.</p>

<p class="p2"><i>August 12th.</i>&mdash;We walked on the pier.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>There were a number of men working
at the ships; and a great many people
were walking about. The women had on
full petticoats, coloured jackets, red aprons,
queer caps, gold chains, long earrings, and
large buckles. The children had high caps,
and very full petticoats, so that when their
backs were turned I took them for dwarfs.
Even some of the babies had old women's
caps and earrings.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Some of the people
had very curious caps trimmed with lace;
one had a cap with the crown filled full of
frills. The most extraordinary-looking creatures
were the fish-women: I could hardly
tell whether they were men or women. They
had on coarse canvas petticoats, so short
that one could see their red garters; blue
jackets, and canvas belts round their waists.
They brought in a great deal of fish this
evening on their backs, which they threw
down in the streets. Soon after the Peace
an English gentleman brought over twelve
of these Dieppe fish-women to Brighton to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>see England; they galloped up and down
the streets like wild things, stopping to drink
at every public-house: he kept them for a
day or two, and then sent them back. The
sea looked so smooth and pretty we wished
to be on it. We saw the Irish come in. We
walked out again in the afternoon beside the
chalk cliffs. There are a number of caves in
them; one large one with doors at the entrance
was full of barrels, etc., and in another
was a very deep well. At each side of the
pier there is a very large crucifix. Some
men were employed driving in posts, and
others in filling holes up with mud. There
were more people to-day at the table d'hôte;
amongst whom was a Frenchman who had a
very rough voice; he had just returned from
England from seeing the Coronation. He
scraped out the inside of his roll, and eat a
great many French beans and oil. In the
evening we saw a child's funeral passing the
window: the coffin was covered with a white
cloth with flowers painted on it. We all got
ready to go down to the ship. Papa had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>taken the ship for ourselves, as it was so disagreeable
when we came to Calais with so
many people. A lady begged that Miss Reed
(her niece), who was sixteen, might go over
with us, as her father was dead, and her
mother wanted her home. She therefore
went in the same ship with us.</p>

<h4>SEA</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>August 12th, 1821.</i>&mdash;We embarked at
eight o'clock on board the <i>Wellington</i>,
Captain Cheeseman: we got down to the
ship by a ladder. The moon shone beautifully
on the sea. The <i>commissaire</i> came
after we were on board; he asked William
how he liked France. William said, 'Je
déteste la France,' and Stewart added, 'Et je
déteste la France aussi.' We went to bed in
the cabin, which was very nicely furnished;
but the beds were small and uncomfortable.
Soon after we felt the ship moving out of
the harbour, and I thought with pleasure
that I should awake far from France. Mamma
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>and Catherine, who slept in another room,
were pretty well; all the rest of us, except
Euphemia, were very sick. The light went
out, and papa was obliged to awake the
steward, who was quite tipsy. The captain
slept on the sofa. The steward went every
now and then to a bottle, and drank out
of it.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>August 13th.</i>&mdash;I awoke very sick. At ten
minutes to six Euphemia went upstairs to
see England. After we had had some tea I
went on deck, where I lay down, very glad
to leave the close, hot cabin. Euphemia was
a very useful little person; she went up and
down, and got us all we wanted. William
and Stewart sang 'Merrily every bosom
boundeth, merrily oh, merrily oh.' I raised
myself up to see England; the sight of the
white cliffs quite refreshed me. A boat came
out at eight o'clock in the evening; it was
very rainy, but we soon got on shore. We
went to the Old Ship Inn; the beds were
<i>very</i> comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<h4>ENGLAND</h4>

<p><i>August 14th.</i><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>&mdash;This morning all our
bones ached after being at sea, and everything
seemed topsy-turvy. It rained so
hard that we could not go out. The rooms
looked very comfortable, and in the drawing-room
there was a pretty clock, and fruit under
glasses. There were two neat, civil chambermaids,
who looked nicer than some of the
French ladies. Our things went to the
Custom House; they examined and opened
out everything. We had to pay for all our
books and drawings, and a smelling-bottle;
and for two pipes which only cost twopence
a-piece we paid eighteenpence, through a
mistake of the servants about the price.</p>


<h4>ARUNDEL</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>August 15th.</i>&mdash;Before we set out for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>Mrs. Howard's<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> at Arundel we went to look
at the Pavilion. I did not much admire it;
it looks like some Chinese thing. We asked
a man if we could go in front of it, but he
answered very rudely that we could not. It
was delightful weather when we set off. It
so happened that both when we left and
when we returned to England it was fine
weather, and very cold while we were in
France. I did not think the country about
Brighton so very ugly as I had heard it was.
We got on the first stage very quickly. We
were particularly struck with the neatness
of the cottages; most of them were covered
with roses or vines, and the grapes were much
more forward than they were in France.
Everybody looked so genteel and nice, and
the children so pretty. There is a steep hill
going into Arundel, and one has a very fine
view of the castle. Before Mrs. Howard's
house there is a small terrace full of flowers;
there were geraniums, and large myrtles
growing out of doors, though in France
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>they are obliged to take the laurels into
the house in winter.</p>


<h4>OWLS</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>August 16th.</i>&mdash;It was <i>very</i> hot to-day.
In the evening we went to see the owls at
the castle. There is a great deal of fine
ivy about the keep. There are altogether
seven owls. One they call 'Lord Thurlow,'
another 'Lord Ellenborough,' and two
others 'barons of the Exchequer'; they
crack their bills very badly. One that had
come from Hudson's Bay could mew, bark,
and make various noises. We afterwards
went along a new walk they were making,
and then through a field in which were
some deer.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>August 18th.</i>&mdash;We were surprised to
observe this morning that the sun was a
bluish silver colour, more like the moon;
we afterwards saw it was noticed in the
newspaper. We went to see the dresses of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>Mr. Wyndham (the Catholic priest), who
lived next door; he was a very civil old
man, and used to bring us in apricots
and gooseberries. His dresses were very
splendid-purple, red, green, gold, etc. We
saw the chapel; there were artificial flowers,
gold candlesticks, etc., on the altar. As
we were walking on the terrace we saw
the Duke and Duchess of Clarence, the
Duchess of Kent, and the Princess Fedor,
the Duchess of Kent's daughter. We saw
them afterwards in a carriage. I never
saw any place with such swarms of children
as Arundel; but I thought them very pretty
after what I had lately seen. The weather
continued oppressively hot.</p>


<h4>CORONATION</h4>

<p class="p2"><i>August 24th.</i>&mdash;We set off five minutes
before seven. It was very foggy. There is
a pretty hill and a good deal of wood going
out of Arundel. After the fog cleared away
it was <i>excessively</i> hot; every person looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>half roasted. There were a number of pretty
cottages; most of which, and even some of
the sheds, were covered with vines, roses,
and jessamines; there were also many remarkably
fine hollyoaks before the doors.
Every person looked clean and neat; there
seemed to be no poverty: we did not meet
with a single beggar. It was delightful to
see the green fields full of sheep and cows,
all looking so happy. There were several
boats full of ladies on the Thames. We saw
London some time before we were in it; it
only appeared like a great deal of smoke.
We scarcely saw any soldiers in London&mdash;very
different to Paris! We arrived at the
New Hummums, Russell Street, at half-past
four. In the evening we went to Drury
Lane and saw the Coronation. The first
play was very ugly. The first scene of the
coronation was a distant view of Westminster
Abbey. There were a number of soldiers
and people painted at a distance. The procession
was very long and beautiful. The
herb-women walked first, strewing the way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>with flowers; they were dressed in white, and
pink roses on their heads, and the first had
on a scarlet mantle. The king had on a
crimson velvet robe with an immense long
train covered with gold stars, and borne by
seven pages. The second scene was the
inside of Westminster Abbey: the ceiling
was covered with scarlet drapery; there were
a great many chandeliers, and one could not
imagine anything more magnificent. There
were painted people in the galleries, and real
people at one end. There was a great deal
of music and a large harmonica. The king
went up to the altar, and they put on him
a purple crown. In the third scene there
came in a sailor who sang a curious song
about the coronation. The fourth scene was
the banquet. There were gold plates and
such a number of lights that they made my
eyes quite sore. The champion came in on
horseback and threw down the glove: two
other men on horseback followed him: the
horses reared and plunged: a man in armour
made of rings stood on each side of him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>It was altogether beautiful. It was very
hot.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>August 25th.</i>&mdash;Before we set off we went
to Covent Garden market, and saw some
beautiful fruit in the shop windows; we
had not time to go through it, but what we
saw was not to be compared to the flower-markets
in Paris. We did not see anything
here very pretty. It was <i>excessively</i> hot
when we set off. We passed several pretty
houses, and we stopped at Hampstead Heath
to see Mr. and Mrs. Spedding.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> We dined
at Welwin, not a very good inn. There
were several nice little girls dancing along
with bundles of corn on their heads. We
slept at Antonbury Hill. It was a nice inn,
and the people were civil.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>August 26th.</i>&mdash;The weather to-day was
quite changed: it was cold and rainy. We
dined at Grantham. In one of the towns
we passed through there were some soldiers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>and a band of music. We slept at Tuxford.
It was a middling inn, and the people were
civil.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>August 27th.</i>&mdash;The weather continued
cold and disagreeable. We breakfasted at
Bawtry. We passed Robin Hood's well.
About Ferry Bridge we saw a number of
people gathering teasels. We dined at
Leeds: it is a dirty, disagreeable town.
Numbers of children ran after the carriage;
sometimes six or seven got up at a time; we
had nothing to do but to watch for them.
The country was very pretty. Before Otley
there is an excessively steep hill; we walked
down it: a number of children got up behind
the carriage. We slept at Otley.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>August 28th.</i>&mdash;It was very rainy when
we set off. We went along by a river; where
was a pretty wooded bay. There was a great
deal of honeysuckle in the hedges, which
smelt very sweet. We breakfasted at Skipton,
where there was a cattle-market; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>saw some hills near Settle; and passed a
pretty rocky river before Kirby Lonsdale.
We stayed all night at Kendal, in the same
room that we were in before, in 1819.</p>


<p class="p2"><i>August 29th.</i>&mdash;We set off at seven, happy
to think we were near the end of our journey.
No person in the inn was ready. It was
a dull morning. We passed Windermere
and breakfasted at Ambleside. After this
we passed some beautiful mountains very
much wooded, and Rydal Water, a pretty
little lake, and also Grasmere. As soon as
we passed the boundary wall and entered
Cumberland the sun came out and shone
brightly for a little while. We saw the blue
mountains peeping up behind, and the clear
mountain streams. We passed Thirlmere,
which is more like a river, and Helvellyn, an
ugly mountain. We saw Keswick Lake;
arrived at Keswick by one o'clock, and stayed
there till three. After we had left this, a
flock of sheep ran on before the carriage for
above a mile with a man and his dog after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>them. The sun shone as we went up Whinlatter;
and we saw the end of Bassenthwaite;
the sixth lake we saw to-day. The time
seemed very short till we reached Cockermouth,
where we saw the new bridge they
were building. At last we arrived in safety
at Tallantire.</p>

French women must, I think, yield the palm to their English

the English ladies were so possessed with a rage for imitating
even the deficiencies of their French sisterhood, that they
actually had recourse to violent means, even to the injury of
their health, to compress their beautiful bosoms as flatly as
possible, and destroy every vestige of those charms for which, of
all other women, they are perhaps the most indebted to nature.'

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
